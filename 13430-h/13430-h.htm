<h2>Preface</h2>
<p>The papers here gathered together represent the activities of a
librarian in directions outside the boundaries of his professional
career, although the influences of it may be detected in them here
and there. Except for those influences they have little connection
and the transition of thought and treatment from one to another may
occasionally seem violent. It may, however, serve to protect the
reader from the assaults of monotony.</p>

<h2><a id="Essay1" name="Essay1">Do Readers Read?</a></h2>
<p class="returnTOC"><a href="#Contents">Return to Table of
Contents</a></p>
<p>Those who are interested in the proper use of our libraries are
asking continually, &ldquo;What do readers read?&rdquo; and the
tables of class-percentages in the annual reports of those
institutions show that librarians are at least making an attempt to
satisfy these queries. But a question that is still more
fundamental and quite as vital is: Do readers read at all? This is
not a paradox, but a common-sense question, as the following
suggestive little incident will show. The librarian-in-charge of a
crowded branch circulating-library in New York City had occasion to
talk, not long ago, to one of her &ldquo;star&rdquo; borrowers, a
youth who had taken out his two good books a week regularly for
nearly a year and whom she had looked upon as a model&mdash;so much
so that she had never thought it necessary to advise with him
regarding his reading. In response to a question this lad made
answer somewhat as follows: &ldquo;Yes, ma&rsquo;am, I&rsquo;m
doing pretty well with my reading. I think I should get on nicely
if I could only once manage to read a book through; but somehow I
can&rsquo;t seem to do it.&rdquo; This boy had actually taken to
his home nearly a hundred books, returning each regularly and
borrowing another, without reading to the end of a single one of
them.</p>
<p>That this case is not isolated and abnormal, but is typical of
the way in which a large class of readers treat books, there is, as
we shall see, only too much reason to believe.</p>
<p>The facts are peculiarly hard to get at. At first sight there
would seem to be no way to find out <span class="pagenum"><a id=
"page4" name="page4"></a>[pg 4]</span>whether the books that our
libraries circulate have been read through from cover to cover, or
only half through, or not at all. To be sure, each borrower might
be questioned on the subject as he returned his book, but this
method, would be resented as inquisitorial, and after all there
would be no certainty that the data so gathered were true. By
counting the stamps on the library book-card or dating-slip we can
tell how many times a book has been borrowed, but this gives us no
information about whether it has or has not been read. Fortunately
for our present purpose, however, many works are published in a
series of volumes, each of which is charged separately, and an
examination of the different slips will tell us whether or not the
whole work has been read through by all those who borrowed it. If,
for instance in a two-volume work each volume has gone out twenty
times, twenty borrowers either have read it through or have stopped
somewhere in the second volume, while if the first volume is
charged twenty times and the second only fourteen, it is certain
that six of those who took out the first volume did not get as far
as the second. In works of more than two volumes we can tell with
still greater accuracy at what point the reader&rsquo;s interest
was insufficient to carry him further.</p>
<p>Such an investigation has been made of all works in more than
one volume contained in seven branches of the Brooklyn Public
Library, and with very few exceptions it has been found that each
successive volume in a series has been read by fewer persons than
the one immediately preceding. What is true of books in more than
one volume is presumably also true, although perhaps in a less
degree, of one-volume works, although we have no means of showing
it directly. Among the readers of every book, then, <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page5" name="page5"></a>[pg 5]</span>there are
generally some who, for one reason or other, do not read it to the
end. Our question, &ldquo;Do readers read?&rdquo; is thus answered
in the negative for a large number of cases. The supplementary
question, &ldquo;Why do not readers read?&rdquo; occurs at once,
but an attempt to answer it would take us rather too deeply into
psychology. Whether this tendency to leave the latter part of books
unread is increasing or not we can tell only by repeating the
present investigation at intervals of a year or more. The
probability is that it is due to pure lack of interest. For some
reason or other, many persons begin to read books that fail to hold
their attention. In a large number of cases this is doubtless due
to a feeling that one &ldquo;ought to read&rdquo; certain books and
certain classes of books. A sense of duty carries the reader part
way through his task, but he weakens before he has finished it.</p>
<p>This shows how necessary it is to stimulate one&rsquo;s general
interest in a subject before advising him to read a book that is
not itself calculated to arouse and sustain that interest. Possibly
the modern newspaper habit, with its encouragement of slipshod
reading, may play its part in producing the general result, and
doubtless a careful detailed investigation would reveal still other
partial causes, but the chief and determining cause must be lack of
interest. And it is to be feared that instead of taking measures to
arouse a permanent interest in good literature, which would in
itself lead to the reading of standard works and would sustain the
reader until he had finished his task, we have often tried to
replace such an interest by a fictitious and temporary stimulus,
due to appeals to duty, or to that vague and confused idea that one
should &ldquo;improve one&rsquo;s mind,&rdquo; unaccompanied by any
definite plan of ways <span class="pagenum"><a id="page6" name=
"page6"></a>[pg 6]</span>and means. There is no more powerful moral
motor than duty, but it loses its force when we try to apply it to
cases that lie without the province of ethics. The man who has no
permanent interest in historical literature, and who is impelled to
begin a six-volume history because he conceives it to be his
&ldquo;duty&rdquo; to read it, is apt to conclude, before he has
finished the second volume, that his is a case where inclination
(or in this instance disinclination) is the proper guide.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, the formation of a cultivated and permanent
taste for good reading is generally a matter of lifelong education.
It must be begun when the child reads his first book. An
encouraging sign for the future is the care that is now taken in
all good libraries to supervise the reading of children and to
provide for them special quarters and facilities. A somewhat
disheartening circumstance, on the other hand, is the
multiplication of annotated and abbreviated children&rsquo;s
editions of all sorts of works that were read by the last
generation of children without any such treatment. This kind of
boned chicken may be very well for the mental invalid, but the
ordinary child prefers to separate his meat from the
&ldquo;drumstick&rdquo; by his own unaided effort, and there is no
doubt that it is better for him to do so.</p>
<p>In the following table, the average circulation of first
volumes, second volumes, etc., is given for each of seven classes
of works. The falling off from volume to volume is noticeable in
each class. It is most marked in science, and least so, as might be
expected, in fiction. Yet it is remarkable that there should be any
falling off at all in fiction. The record shows that the proportion
of readers who cannot even read to the end of a novel is relatively
large. These are <span class="pagenum"><a id="page7" name=
"page7"></a>[pg 7]</span>doubtless the good people who speak of
Dickens as &ldquo;solid reading&rdquo; and who regard Thackeray
with as remote an eye as they do Gibbon. For such &ldquo;The
Duchess&rdquo; furnishes good mental pabulum, and Miss Corelli
provides flights into the loftier regions of philosophy.</p>

</table>
<p>The figures in the table, as has been stated, are averages, and
the number of cases averaged decreases rapidly as we reach the
later volumes, because, of course, the number of works that run
beyond four or five volumes is relatively small. Hence the figures
for the higher volumes are irregular. Any volume may have been
withdrawn separately for reference without any intention of reading
its companions. Among the earlier volumes such use counts for
little, owing to the large number of volumes averaged, while it may
and does make the figures for the later volumes irregular. Thus,
under History the high number in the twelfth column represents
one-twelfth volume of Froude, which was taken out three times,
evidently for separate reference, as the eleventh was withdrawn but
once. Furthermore, apart from this irregularity, the figures for
the later volumes are relatively large, for a work in many volumes
is apt to be a standard, and although its use falls rapidly from
start to finish enough readers persevere to the <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page8" name="page8"></a>[pg 8]</span>end to make
the final averages compare unduly well with the initial ones where
the high use of the same work is averaged in with smaller use of
dozens of other first and second volumes. That the falling off from
beginning to end in such long works is much more striking than
would appear from the averages alone may be seen from the following
records of separate works in numerous volumes:</p>

<p>Of course, these could be multiplied indefinitely. They are
sufficiently interesting apart from all comment. One would hardly
believe without direct evidence that of thirty-one persons who
began one of Dumas&rsquo;s romances scarcely half would read it to
the end, or that not one of five persons who essayed
Dickens&rsquo;s &ldquo;Mutual Friend&rdquo; would succeed in

<p>A curious fact is that the tendency to attempt to &ldquo;begin

collected works in which there is no sequence from volume to

<p>In the case of the two-volume works the interest-sustaining

<h2><a id="Essay2" name="Essay2">What Makes People Read?</a></h2>
<p class="returnTOC"><a href="#Contents">Return to Table of
Contents</a></p>
<p>Does the reading public read because it has a literary taste or
for some other reason? In the case of the public library, for
instance, does a man start with an overwhelming desire to read or
study books and is he impelled thereby to seek out the place where
he may most easily and best obtain them? Or is he primarily
attracted to the library by some other consideration, his love for
books and reading acting only in a secondary manner? The New York
Public Library, for instance, carries on the registry books of its
circulating department nearly 400,000 names, and in the course of a
year nearly 35,000 new applications are made for the use of its
branch libraries, scattered over different parts of the city. What
brings these people to the library? This is no idle question. The
number of library users, large as it is, represents too small a
fraction of our population. If it is a good thing to provide free
reading matter for our people&mdash;and every large city in the
country has committed itself to the truth of this
proposition&mdash;we should certainly try to see that what we
furnish is used by all who need it. Hence an examination into the
motives that induce people to make their first use of a free public
library may bring out information that is not only interesting but
useful. To this end several hundred regular users of the branches
of the New York Public Library were recently asked this question
directly, and the answers are tabulated and discussed below. In
each of sixteen branch libraries the persons interrogated numbered
forty&mdash;ten each of men, women, boys and <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page12" name="page12"></a>[pg 12]</span>girls.
Thirty answers have been thrown out for irrelevancy or
defectiveness. The others are classified in the following

<p>It will be seen that the vast majority of those questioned were
led to the library by some circumstance other than the simple
desire to find a place where books could be obtained. Of more than
six hundred persons whose answers are here recorded only fourteen
found the library as the result of a direct search for it prompted
by a desire to read. In a majority of the other cases, of course,
perhaps in all of them, the desire to read had its part, but this
desire was awakened by hearing a mention of the library or by
seeing it or something connected with it. These determining
circumstances fall into two classes, those that worked through the
ear and those that operated through the eye.</p>
<p>Those who <em>heard</em> of the library in some way numbered
449, while those who <em>saw</em> it or something connected with it
were only 147&mdash;an interesting fact, especially as we are told
by psychologists that apprehension and memory through sight are of
a higher type than the same functions where exercised through
hearing. Probably, however, this difference was dependent on the
fact that the thing heard <span class="pagenum"><a id="page13"
name="page13"></a>[pg 13]</span>was in most cases a direct
injunction or a piece of advice, while the thing seen did not act
with similar urgency. There are some surprises in the table. For
instance, only four persons were sent directly to libraries by
persons employed therein. Doubtless the average library assistant
wishes to get as far from &ldquo;shop&rdquo; as possible in her
leisure hours, but it is still disappointing to find that those who
are employed in our libraries exercise so little influence in
bringing persons to use them. The same thing is true of the
influence of reading rooms. In many of the branch libraries in New
York there are separate reading rooms to which others than
card-holders in the library are admitted, and one of the chief
arguments for this has been that the user of such a room, having
become accustomed to resort to the library building, would be apt
to use the books. Apparently, however, such persons are in the
minority. No less disappointing is the slight influence of the
clergy. Only four persons report this as a determining influence
and these were all women connected with a branch which was formerly
the parish library of a New York church.</p>
<p>The influence of the press, too, seems to amount to little, in
spite of the fact that the newspapers in New York have freely
commented on the valuable work of the branch libraries and have
called attention to it both in the news and editorial columns
whenever occasion offered. Do the readers of library books in New
York shun the public-press, or do they pay scant heed to what they
read therein?</p>
<p>Another somewhat noteworthy fact is that of the 449 persons who
sought the library by advice of some one, only 89 were sent by
teachers. But perhaps this is unfair. Of 265 boys and girls who
thus came to <span class="pagenum"><a id="page14" name=
"page14"></a>[pg 14]</span>the library, only 71 were sent by
teachers. This is a larger percentage, but it is still not so large
as we might expect.</p>
<p>The difference between adults and children comes out quite
strikingly in a few instances. We should have foreseen this of
course in the case of advice by teachers, which was reported by 71
children and only 18 adults as a reason for visiting the library.
Here we should not have expected this reason to be given by adults
at all. Doubtless these were chiefly young men and women who had
used the library since their school-days. In like manner the advice
or injunction of relatives was more patent with children than with
adults, the proportion here being 62 to 24. This probably
illustrates the power of parental injunction. In another case the
difference comes out in a wholly unexpected way. Of the 71 persons
who reported that they were attracted to the library by seeing the
buildings, 57 were adults and only 14 children. The same is true of
those who were led in by seeing a sign, who numbered 41 adults to
only 9 children. This seems to show either that adults are more
observant or that children are more diffident in following out an
impulse of this kind. It completely negatives the ordinary
impression among librarians, at least in New York, where it has
been believed that the sight of a library building, especially
where the work going on inside is visible from the street, is a
potent attraction to the young. Some of the new branch buildings in
New York have even been planned with a special view to the exercise
of this kind of attraction.</p>
<p>The small number of persons who were attracted by printed
matter, in library or general publications, were entirely adults.
The one instance where age seems to exercise no particular
influence is that <span class="pagenum"><a id="page15" name=
"page15"></a>[pg 15]</span>of the advice of friends, by which old
and young alike seem to have profited.</p>
<p>The influence of sex does not appear clearly, although among
those who followed the injunction of relatives the women and girls
are slightly in the majority, and the four who were sent by
clergymen were all women. Of those who were attracted by the
buildings 46 were male and 25 female, which may mean that men are
somewhat more observant or less diffident than women.</p>
<p>A few of those questioned relate their experiences at some
length. Says one boy: &ldquo;A boy friend of mine said he belonged
to this library and he found some very good books here. He asked me
if I wanted to join; I said yes. He told me I would have to get a
reference. I got one, and joined this library.&rdquo; Another one
reports: &ldquo;I saw a boy in the street and asked him where he
was going. He said he was going to the library. I asked him what
the library was and he told me; so I came up here and have been
coming ever since.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Critical judgment is shown by some of the young people. One boy
says: &ldquo;I heard all the other boys saying it was a good
library and that the books were better kept than in a majority of
libraries.&rdquo; A girl says that friends &ldquo;told her what
nice books were in this library.&rdquo; In one case a boy&rsquo;s
brother &ldquo;told him he could get the best books here for his
needs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The combination of man and book seems to be very attractive. One
child &ldquo;saw a boy in school with a book, telling what a boy
should know about electricity; I wanted to read that book and
joined the library.&rdquo; Others &ldquo;followed a crowd of little
boys with books&rdquo;; &ldquo;saw children taking books out of the
building and asked them about joining&rdquo;; &ldquo;saw a boy
carrying books and asked if there was a library in <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page16" name="page16"></a>[pg 16]</span>the
neighborhood.&rdquo; A woman &ldquo;saw a child with a library book
in the park and asked her for the address of the library.&rdquo;
Sometimes the book alone does the work, as shown by the following
laconic report: &ldquo;Found a book in the park; took it to the
library; joined it.&rdquo; A cause of sorrow to many librarians who
have decided ideas regarding literature for children will be the
report of a boy who exclaimed: &ldquo;Horatio Alger did it!&rdquo;
On being asked to explain, he said that a friend had brought one of
Alger&rsquo;s books to his house and that he was thereby attracted
to the library.</p>
<p>Among those who were brought in by relatives are children who
were first carried by their mothers to the library as infants and
so grew naturally into its use. Sometimes the influence works
upward instead of downward, for several adults report that their
children brought them to the library or induced them to visit it.
One man reports that he &ldquo;got married and his wife induced him
to come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Some of the reasons given are curious. A few are unconnected
with the use of books. One girl came to the library because
&ldquo;it was a very handy library&rdquo;; another, because she
&ldquo;saw it was a nice place to come to on a rainy day.&rdquo;
Still another frankly avows that &ldquo;it was the fad among the
boys and girls of our neighborhood; we used to meet at the
library.&rdquo; A postman reported that he entered the library
first in the line of his duty, but was attracted by it and began to
take out books. A clergyman had his attention called to the library
by requests from choir-boys that he should sign their application
blanks; afterwards thinking that he might find books there for his
own reading, he became a regular user. One user came first to the
library to see an exhibition of pictures of old New York. A recent
importation <span class="pagenum"><a id="page17" name=
"page17"></a>[pg 17]</span>says: &ldquo;When I came from Paris I
found all my cousins speaking English; &lsquo;well,&rsquo; they
said, &lsquo;go to the library and take books&rsquo;&rdquo;&mdash;a
process that doubtless did its share toward making an American of
the new arrival. In another case, the Americanizing process has not
yet reached the stage where the user&rsquo;s English is altogether
intelligible. He says: &ldquo;Because I like to read the book. I
ask the bakery lady to my reference and I sing my neam&rdquo; [sign
my name?].</p>
<p>Here are some examples of recently acquired elegance in diction
that are almost baboo-like in their hopelessness: &ldquo;Because it
interest about the countries that are far away. It gives knowledge
to many of the people in this country.&rdquo; &ldquo;So as to
obtain knowledge from them and by reading books find out how the
great men were in their former days and all about them and the
world and its people.&rdquo; It will be seen that the last two
writers were among those who misunderstood our questions and told
why they read books rather than how they were first led to the use
of a library.</p>
<p>These reports are far from possessing merely a passing interest
for the curious. For the public librarian, whose wish it is to
reach as large a proportion of the public as possible, they are
full of valuable hints. They emphasize, for instance, the urgent
necessity of winning the good will of the public, and they forcibly
remind us that this is of more value in gaining a foothold for the
library than columns of notices in the papers or thousands of
circulars or cards distributed in the neighborhood. It is even more
potent than a beautiful building. Attractive as this is, its value
as an influence to secure new readers is vastly less than a
reputation for hospitality and helpfulness.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page18" name="page18"></a>[pg
18]</span>In looking over the figures one rather disquieting
thought cannot be kept down. If the good will of the public is so
potent in increasing the use of the library, the ill will of the
same public must be equally potent in the opposite direction. Some
of those who are satisfied with us and our work are here put on
record. How about the dissatisfied? A record of these might be even
more interesting, for it would point out weaknesses to be
strengthened and errors to be avoided&mdash;but that, as Kipling
says, &ldquo;is another story.&rdquo;</p>

<h2><a id="Essay3" name="Essay3">The Passing of The Possessive: A
Study of Book-Titles</a></h2>
<p class="returnTOC"><a href="#Contents">Return to Table of
Contents</a></p>
<p>If there is one particular advantage possessed by the Teutonic
over the Romance languages in idiomatic clearness and precision it
is that conferred by their ownership of a possessive case, almost
the sole remaining monument to the fact that our ancestors spoke an
inflected tongue. That we should still be able to speak of
&ldquo;the baker&rsquo;s wife&rsquo;s dog&rdquo; instead of
&ldquo;the dog of the wife of the baker&rdquo; certainly should be
regarded by English-speaking people as a precious birthright. Yet,
there are increasing evidences of a tendency to discard this only
remaining case-ending and to replace its powerful backbone with the
comparatively limp and cartilaginous preposition. This tendency has
not yet appeared so much in our spoken as in our written language,
and even here only in the most formal parts of it. It is especially
noticeable in the diction of the purely formal title and
heading.</p>
<p>That the reader may have something beyond an unsupported
assertion that this is the case, I purpose to offer in evidence the
titles of some recent works of fiction, and to make a brief
statistical study of them.</p>
<p>The titles were taken from the adult fiction lists in the
Monthly Bulletins of the New York Free Circulating Library from
November, 1895, to March, 1897, inclusive, and are all such titles
as contain a possessive, whether expressed by the possessive case
or by the preposition &ldquo;of&rdquo; with the objective. Some
titles are included in which the grammatical relation is slightly
different, but all admit the alternative of <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page20" name="page20"></a>[pg 20]</span>the
case-ending &ldquo;&lsquo;s&rdquo; or &ldquo;of&rdquo; followed by
the objective case.</p>
<p>Of the 101 titles thus selected, 41 use the possessive case and
60 the objective with the preposition. This proportion is in itself
sufficiently suggestive, but it becomes still more so by comparing
it with the corresponding proportion among a different set of
titles. For this purpose 101 fiction titles were selected, just as
they appeared in alphabetical order, from a library catalogue
bearing the date 1889; only those being taken, as before, that
contain a possessive. Of these 101, 71 use the possessive case and
30 the objective with &ldquo;of.&rdquo; In other words, where eight
years ago nearly three-quarters of such titles used the possessive
case, now only two-fifths use it, a proportionate reduction of
nearly one-half.</p>
<p>The change appears still more striking when we study the titles
a little more closely. Of those in the earlier series there is not
one that is not good, idiomatic English as it stands, whichever
form is used; we may even say that there is not one that would not
be made less idiomatic by a change to the alternative form. Among
the recent titles, however, while the forms using the possessive
case are all better as they are, of the 60 titles that use the
objective with &ldquo;of&rdquo; only 22 would be injured by a
change, and the reason why 8 of these are better as they are is
simply that change would destroy euphony. Among these eight are</p>
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;The Indiscretion of the Duchess,&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;The Flight of a Shadow,&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;The Secret of Narcisse,&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p class="noindent">where the more idiomatic forms,</p>
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;The Duchess&rsquo;s Indiscretion,&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Narcisse&rsquo;s Secret,&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;A Shadow&rsquo;s Flight,&rdquo; etc.,</li>
</ul>
<p class="noindent">are certainly not euphonic.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page21" name="page21"></a>[pg
21]</span>Of the others, 8 would not be injured by a change, and no
less than 30 would be improved from the standpoint of idiomatic
English. It may be well to quote these thirty titles. They are:</p>
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;The Shadow of Hilton Fernbrook,&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;The Statement of Stella Maberly,&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;The Shadow of John Wallace,&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;The Banishment of Jessop Blythe,&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;The Desire of the Moth,&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;The Island of Dr. Moreau,&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;The Damnation of Theron Ware,&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;The Courtship of Morrice Buckler,&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;The Daughter of a Stoic,&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;The Lament of Dives,&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;The Heart of Princess Osra,&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;The Death of the Lion,&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;The Vengeance of James Vansittart,&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;The Wife of a Vain Man,&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;The Crime of Henry Vane,&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;The Son of Old Harry,&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;The Honour of Savelli,&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;The Life of Nancy,&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;The Story of Lawrence Garthe,&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;The Marriage of Esther,&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;The House of Martha,&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Tales of an Engineer,&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Love-letters of a Worldly Woman,&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;The Way of a Maid,&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;The Soul of Pierre,&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;The Day of Their Wedding,&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;The Exploits of Brigadier Gerard,&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;The Hand of Ethelberta,&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;The Failure of Sibyl Fletcher,&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;The Love-affairs of an Old Maid.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, in such a division as this, much must depend on
individual judgment and bias. Probably no two persons would divide
the list in just the same way, but it is my belief that the general
result in each case would be much the same. To me the possessive
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page22" name="page22"></a>[pg
22]</span>in every one of the above-quoted titles would have been
more idiomatic, thus:</p>
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;Hilton Fernbrook&rsquo;s Shadow,&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Stella Maberly&rsquo;s Statement,&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;John Wallace&rsquo;s Shadow,&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Morrice Buckler&rsquo;s Courtship,&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;A Stoic&rsquo;s Daughter,&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Henry Vane&rsquo;s Crime,&rdquo; etc., etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>In one case, at least, this fact has been recognized by a
publisher, for &ldquo;The Vengeance of James Vansittart,&rdquo;
whose title is included in the list given above, has appeared in a
later edition as &ldquo;James Vansittart&rsquo;s
Vengeance&rdquo;&mdash;a palpable improvement.</p>
<p>I shall not discuss the cause of this change in the use of the
possessive, though it seems to me an evident Gallicism, nor shall I
open the question of whether it is a mere passing fad or the
beginning of an actual alteration in the language. However this may
be, it seems undeniable that there is an actual and considerable
difference in the use of the possessive to-day and its use ten
years ago, at least in formal titles and headings. I have confined
myself to book-titles, because that is the department where the
tendency presents itself to me most clearly; but it may be seen on
street signs, in advertisements, and in newspaper headings. It is
not to be found yet in the spoken language, at least it is not
noticeable there, but it would be decidedly unsafe to prophesy that
it will never appear there. Ten years from now we may hear about
&ldquo;the breaking of the arm of John Smith&rdquo; and &ldquo;the
hat of Tom,&rdquo; without a thought that these phrases have not
been part of our idiomatic speech since Shakespeare&rsquo;s
time.</p>

<p>Since Darwin called attention to the role of what he named
&ldquo;natural selection&rdquo; in the genesis and preservation of
species, and since his successors, both followers and opponents,
have added to this many other kinds of selection that are
continually operative, it has become increasingly evident that from
one standpoint we may look on the sum of natural processes, organic
and inorganic, as a vast selective system, as the result of which
things are as they are, whether the results are the positions of
celestial bodies or the relative places of human beings in the
intellectual or social scale. The exact constitution of the present
population of New York is the result of a great number of selective
acts, some regular, others more or less haphazard. Selection is no
less selection because it occurs by what we call chance&mdash;for
chance is only our name for the totality of trivial and
unconsidered causes. When, however, we count man and man&rsquo;s
efforts in the sum of natural objects and forces, we have to reckon
with his intelligence in these selective processes. I desire to
call attention to the place that they play in educative systems and
in particular to the way in which they may be furthered or made
more effective by books, especially by public collections of
books.</p>
<p>When we think of any kind of training as it affects the
individual, we most naturally regard it as changing that
individual, as making him more fit, either for life in general or
for some special form of life&rsquo;s activities. But when we think
of it as affecting <span class="pagenum"><a id="page24" name=
"page24"></a>[pg 24]</span>a whole community or a whole nation, we
may regard it as essentially a selective process. In a given
community it is not only desirable that a certain number of men
should be trained to do a specified kind of work, but it is even
more desirable that these should be the men that are best fitted to
do this work. When Mr. Luther Burbank brings into play the
selection by means of which he achieves his remarkable results in
plant breeding he gets rid of the unfit by destruction, and as all
are unfit for the moment that do not advance the special end that
he has in view, he burns up plants&mdash;new and interesting
varieties perhaps&mdash;by the hundred thousand. We cannot destroy
the unfit, nor do we desire to do so, for from the educational
point of view unfitness is merely bad adjustment. There is a place
for every man in the world and it is the educators business to see
that he reaches it, if not by formative, then by selective
processes. This selection is badly made in our present state of
civilization. It depends to a large extent upon circumstances
remote from the training itself&mdash;upon caprice, either that of
the person to be trained or of his parents, upon accidents of birth
or situation, upon a thousand irrelevant things; but in every case
there are elements present in the training itself that aid in
determining it. A young man begins to study medicine, and he finds
that his physical repulsion for work in the dissecting-room can not
be overcome. He abandons the study and by doing so eliminates an
unfit person. A boy who has no head for figures enters a business
college. He can not get his diploma, and the community is spared
one bad bookkeeper. Certainly in some instances, possibly in all,
technical and professional schools that are noted for the
excellence of their product are superior not so much because they
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page25" name="page25"></a>[pg
25]</span>have better methods of training, but because their
material is of better quality, owing to selection exercised either
purposely, or automatically, or perhaps by some chance. The same is
true of colleges. Of two institutions with the same curriculum and
equally able instructors, the one with the widest reputation will
turn out the best graduates because it attracts abler men from a
wider field. This is true even in such a department as athletics.
To him that hath shall be given. This is purely an automatic
selective effect.</p>
<p>It would appear desirable to dwell more upon selective features
in educational training, to ascertain what they are in each case
and how they work, and to control and dispose them with more
systematic care. Different minds will always attach different
degrees of importance to natural and acquired fitness, but probably
all will agree that training bestowed upon the absolutely unfit is
worse than useless, and that there are persons whose natural
aptitudes are so great that upon them a minimum of training will
produce a maximum effect. Such selective features as our present
educational processes possess, the examination, for instance, are
mostly exclusive; they aim to bar out the unfit rather than to
attract the fit. Here is a feature on which some attention may well
be fixt.</p>
<p>How do these considerations affect the subject of general
education? Are we to affirm that arithmetic is only for the born
mathematician and Latin for the born linguist, and endeavor to
ascertain who these may be? Not so; for here we are training not
experts but citizens. Discrimination here must be not in the
quality but in the quantity of training. We may divide the members
of any community into classes according as their formal
education&mdash;their <span class="pagenum"><a id="page26" name=
"page26"></a>[pg 26]</span>school and college training&mdash;has
lasted one, two, three, four, or more years. There has been a
selection here, but it has operated, in general, even more
imperfectly than in the case of special training. Persons who are
mentally qualified to continue their schooling to the end of a
college course, and who by so doing would become more useful
members of the community, are obliged to be content with two or
three years in the lower grades, while others, who are unfitted for
the university, are kept at it until they take, or fail to take,
the bachelor&rsquo;s degree. An ideal state of things, of course,
would be to give each person the amount of general education for
which he is fitted and then stop. This would be difficult of
realization even if financial considerations did not so often
interfere. But at least we may keep in view the desirability of
preventing too many misfits and of insisting, so far as possible,
on any selective features that we may discover in present
systems.</p>
<p>For instance, a powerful selective feature is the attractiveness
of a given course of study to those who are desired to pursue it.
If we can find a way, for example, to make our high school courses
attractive to those who are qualified to take them, while at the
same time rendering them very distasteful to those who are not so
qualified, we shall evidently have taken a step in the right
direction. It is clear that both parts of this prescription must be
taken together or there is no true selection. Much has been done of
late years toward making educational courses of all kinds
interesting and attractive, but it is to be feared that their
attractiveness has been such as to appeal to the unfit as well as
to the fit. If we sugar-coat our pills indiscriminately and mix
them with candy, many will partake who need another kind of
medicine altogether. We must so arrange <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page27" name="page27"></a>[pg 27]</span>things
that the fit will like while the unfit dislike, and for this
purpose the less sugar-coating the better. This is no easy problem
and it is intended merely to indicate it here, not to propose a
general solution.</p>
<p>The one thing to which attention should be directed is the role
that may be and is played by the printed book in selective
education. There is more or less effort to discredit books as
educative tools and to lay emphasis on oral instruction and manual
training. We need not decry these, but, it must be remembered that
after all the book contains the record of man&rsquo;s progress; we
may tell how to do a thing, and show how to do it, but we shall
never do it in a better way or explain the why and wherefore, and
surely transmit that ability and that explanation to posterity,
without the aid of a stable record of some kind. If we are sure
that our students could and would pick out only what they needed,
as a wild animal picks his food in the woods, we might go far
toward solving our problem, by simply turning them loose in a
collection of books. Some people have minds that qualify them to
profit by such &ldquo;browsing,&rdquo; and some of these have
practically educated themselves in a library. Even in the more
common cases where formal training is absolutely necessary, access
to other books than text-books is an aid to selection both
qualitative and quantitative. Books may serve as samples. To take
an extreme case, a boy who had no knowledge whatever of the nature
of law or medicine would certainly not be competent to choose
between them in selecting a profession, and a month spent in a
library where there were books on both subjects would certainly
operate to lessen his incompetence. Probably it would not be rash
to assert that with free access to books, under proper <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page28" name="page28"></a>[pg 28]</span>guidance,
both before and during a course of training, the persons who begin
that course will include more of the fit and those who finish it
will include less of the unfit, than without such access.</p>
<p>Let us consider one or two concrete examples. A college boy has
the choice of several different courses. He knows little of them,
but thinks that one will meet his needs. He elects it and finds too
late that he is wasting his time. Another boy, whose general
reading has been sufficient to give him some superficial knowledge
of the subject-matter in all the courses, sees clearly which will
benefit him, and profits by that knowledge.</p>
<p>Again, a boy, full of the possibilities that would lead him to
appreciate the best in literature, has gained his knowledge of it
from a teacher who looks upon a literary masterpiece only as
something to be dissected. The student has been disgusted instead
of inspired, and his whole life has been deprived of one of the
purest and most uplifting of all influences. Had he been brought up
in a library where he could make literary friends and develop
literary enthusiasms, his course with the dry as dust teacher would
have been only an unpleasant incident, instead of the wrecking of a
part of his intellectual life.</p>
<p>Still again, a boy on a farm has vague aspirations. He knows
that he wants a broader horizon, to get away from his cramped
environment&mdash;that is about all. How many boys, impelled by
such feelings, have gone out into the world with no clear idea of
what they are fitted to do, or even what they really desire! To how
many others has the companionship of a few books meant the opening
of a peep-hole, thru which, dimly perhaps, but none the less
really, have been descried definite possibilities, needs, and
opportunities!</p>
<p>To all of these youths books have been selective <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page29" name="page29"></a>[pg 29]</span>aids
merely&mdash;they have added little or nothing to the actual
training whose extent and character they have served to point out.
Such cases, which it would be easy to multiply, illustrate the
value of books in the selective functions of training. To assert
that they exercise such a function is only another way of saying
that a mind orients itself by the widest contact with other minds.
There are other ways of assuring this contact, and these should not
be neglected; but only thru books can it approach universality both
in space and in time. How else could we know exactly what Homer and
St. Augustine and Descartes thought and what Tolstoi and Lord
Kelvin and William James, we will say, are even now thinking?</p>
<p>It has scarcely been necessary to say all this to convince you
of the value of books as aids to education; but it is certainly
interesting to find that in an examination of the selective
processes in education, we meet with our old friends in such an
important role.</p>
<p>A general collection of books, then, constitutes an important
factor in the selective part of an education. Where shall we place
this collection? I venture to say that altho every school must have
a library to aid in the formative part of its training, the library
as a selective aid should be large and central and should
preferably be at the disposal of the student not only during the
period of his formal training, but before and after it. This points
to the public library, and to close cooperation between it and the
school, rather than to the expansion of the classroom library. This
is, perhaps, not the place to dispute the wisdom of our Board of
Education in developing classroom libraries, but it may be proper
to put in a plea for confining them to books that bear more
particularly on the subjects of instruction. The general collection
of books should be outside of <span class="pagenum"><a id="page30"
name="page30"></a>[pg 30]</span>the school, because the boy is
destined to spend most of his life outside of the school. His
education by no means ends with his graduation. The agents that
operate to develop and change him will be at work so long as he
lives, and it is desirable that the book should be one of these. If
he says good-by to the book when he leaves school, that part of his
training is likely to be at an end. If he uses, in connection with,
and parallel to, his formal education a general collection of books
outside of the school, he will continue to use it after he leaves
school. And even so far as the special classroom library is
concerned, it must be evident that a large general collection of
books that may be drawn upon freely is a useful supplement. For the
teacher&rsquo;s professional use, the larger the collection at his
disposal the better. A sum of money spent by the city in improving
and making adequate the pedagogical section of its public library,
particularly in the department of circulation, will be expended to
greater advantage than many times the amount devoted to a large
number of small collections on the same subjects in schools.</p>
<p>These are the considerations that have governed the New York
Public Library in its effort to be of assistance to the teachers
and pupils in the public schools of the city. Stated formally,
these efforts manifest themselves in the following directions:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>(1) The making of library use continuous from the earliest
possible age, thru school life and afterwards;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(2) Cooperation with the teacher in guiding and limiting the
child&rsquo;s reading during the school period;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(3) Aid within the library in the preparation of school
work;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(4) The supplementing of classroom libraries by the loan of
books in quantity;</p>
</li>
<li><span class="pagenum"><a id="page31" name="page31"></a>[pg
31]</span>
<p>(5) The cultivation of personal relations between library
assistants and teachers in their immediate neighborhood;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(6) The furnishing of accurate and up-to-date information to
schools regarding the library&rsquo;s resources and its willingness
to place them at the school&rsquo;s disposal;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(7) The increase of the library&rsquo;s circulation collection
along lines suggested and desired by teachers;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(8) The granting of special privileges to teachers and special
students who use the library for purposes of study.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Toward the realization of these aims three departments are now
cooperating, each of them in charge of an expert in his or her
special line of work.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>(1) The children&rsquo;s rooms in the various libraries, now
under the direction of an expert supervisor.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(2) The traveling library office.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(3) The division of school work, with an assistant in each
branch, under skilled headquarters superintendence.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>When our plans, which are already in good working order, are
completely carried out, we shall be able to guarantee to every
child guidance in his reading up to and thru his school course,
with direction in a line of influence that will make him a user of
books thruout his life and create in him a feeling of attachment to
the public library as the home and dispenser of books and as a
permanent intellectual refuge from care, trouble, and material
things in general, as well as a mine of information on all subjects
that may benefit or interest him.</p>
<p>Some of the obstacles to the immediate realization of our plans
in full may be briefly stated as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>(1) Lack of sufficient funds. With more money <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page32" name="page32"></a>[pg 32]</span>we could
buy more books, pay higher salaries, and employ more persons. The
assistants in charge of children&rsquo;s rooms should be women of
the highest culture and ability, and it is difficult to secure
proper persons at our present salaries. Assistants in charge of
school work must be persons of tact and quickness of perception,
and they should have no other work to do; whereas at present we are
obliged to give this work to library assistants in addition to
their ordinary routine duties, to avoid increasing our staff by
about forty assistants, which our appropriation does not
permit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(2) Misunderstanding on the part of the public, and also to some
extent on the part of teachers, of our aims, ability, and attitude.
This I am glad to say is continually lessening. We can scarcely
expect that each of our five hundred assistants should be thoroly
imbued with the spirit of helpfulness toward the schools or even
that they should perfectly understand what we desire and aim to do.
Nor can we expect that our wish to aid should be appreciated by
every one of fifty thousand teachers or a million parents. This
will come in time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(3) A low standard of honesty on the part of certain users of
the library. It is somewhat disheartening to those who are laboring
to do a public service to find that some of those whom they are
striving to benefit, look upon them merely as easy game. To prevent
this and at the same time to withstand those who urge that such
misuse of the library should be met by the withdrawal of present
privileges and facilities uses up energy that might otherwise be
directed toward the improvement of our service. Now, like the
intoxicated man, we sometimes refuse invitations to advance because
it is &ldquo;all we can do to stay where we are.&rdquo; Here is an
opportunity for all the selective influences that we may bring to
bear, and <span class="pagenum"><a id="page33" name=
"page33"></a>[pg 33]</span>unfortunately the library can have but
little part in these.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Have I wandered too far from my theme? The good that a public
library may do, the influence that it may exert, and the position
that it may assume in a community, depend very largely on the
ability and tact with which it is administered and the resources at
its disposal. Its public services may be various, but probably
there is no place in which it may be of more value than side by
side with the public school; and I venture to think that this is
the case largely because education to be complete must select as
well as train, must compel the fit to step forward and the unfit to
retire, and must do this, not only at the outset of a course of
training but continuously thruout its duration. We speak of a
student being &ldquo;put thru the mill,&rdquo; and we must not
forget that a mill not only grinds and stamps into shape but also
sifts and selects. A finished product of a given grade is always
such not only by virtue of formation and adaptation but also by
virtue of selection. In human training one of the most potent of
these selective agencies is the individual will, and to train that
will and make it effective in the right direction there is nothing
better than constant association with the records of past aims and
past achievements. This must be my excuse for saying so much of
libraries in general, and of one library in particular, in an
address on what I have ventured to give the name of Selective
Education.</p>

<p class="returnTOC"><a href="#Contents">Return to Table of
Contents</a></p>
<p>Literature is becoming daily more of a dynamic and less of a
static phenomenon. In other days the great body of written records
remained more or less stable and with its attendant body of
tradition did its work by a sort of quiet pressure on that portion
of the community just beneath it&mdash;on a special class
peculiarly subject to its influence. To-day we have added to this
effect that of a moving multitude of more or less ephemeral books,
which appear, do their work, and pass on out of sight. They are
light, but they make up for their lack of weight by the speed and
ease with which they move. Owing to them the use of books is
becoming less and less limited to a class, and more and more
familiar to the masses. The book nowadays is in motion. Even the
classics, the favorites of other days, have left their musty
shelves and are moving out among the people. Where one man knew and
loved Shakespeare a century ago, a thousand know and love him
to-day. The literary blood is circulating and in so doing is giving
life to the body politic. In thus wearing itself out the book is
creating a public appreciation that makes itself felt in a demand
for reprinting, hence worthy books are surer of perpetuation in
this swirling current than they were in the old time reservoir. But
besides these books whose literary life is continuous, though their
paper and binding may wear out, there are other books that vanish
utterly. By the time that the material part of them needs renewing,
the book <span class="pagenum"><a id="page36" name="page36"></a>[pg
36]</span>itself has done its work. Its value at that moment is not
enough, or is not sufficiently appreciated, to warrant reprinting.
It drops out of sight and its place is taken by another, fresh from
the press. This part of our moving literature is what is called
ephemeral, and properly so; but no stigma necessarily attaches to
the name. In the first place, it is impossible to draw a line
between the ephemeral and the durable. &ldquo;One storm in the
world&rsquo;s history has never cleared off,&rdquo; said the
wit&mdash;&ldquo;the one we are having now.&rdquo; Yet the
conditions of to-day, literary as well as meteorological, are not
necessarily lasting.</p>
<p>We are accustomed to regard what we call standard literature as
necessarily the standard of innumerable centuries to come,
forgetful of the fact that other so-called standards have
&ldquo;had their day and ceased to be.&rdquo; Some literature lasts
a century, some a year, some a week; where shall we draw the line
below which all must be condemned as ephemeral? Is it not possible
that all literary work that quickly achieves a useful purpose and
having achieved it passes at once out of sight, may really count
for as much as one that takes the course of years to produce its
slow results? The most ephemeral of all our literary
productions&mdash;the daily paper&mdash;is incalculably the most
influential, and its influence largely depends on this dynamic
quality that has been noted&mdash;the penetrative power of a thing
of light weight moving at a high speed. And this penetrative power
effective literature must have to-day on account of the vastly
increased mass of modern readers.</p>
<p>Reading is no longer confined to a class, it is well-nigh
universal, in our own country, at least. And the habit of mind of
the thoughtful and intent reader is not an affair of one generation
but of many. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page37" name=
"page37"></a>[pg 37]</span>New readers are young readers, and they
have the characteristics of intellectual youth.</p>
<p>Narrative&mdash;the recapitulation of one&rsquo;s own or someone
else&rsquo;s experience, the telling of a story&mdash;is the
earliest form in which artistic effort of any kind is appreciated.
The pictorial art that appeals to the young or the ignorant is the
kind that tells a story&mdash;perhaps historical painting on
enormous canvasses, perhaps the small genre picture, possibly
something symbolic or mythological; but at any rate it must embody
a narrative, whether it is that of the signing of a treaty, a
charge of dragoons, a declaration of love or the feeding of
chickens. The same is true of music. The popular song tells
something, almost without exception. Even in instrumental music,
outside of dance rhythms, whose suggestion of the delights of
bodily motion is a reason of their popularity, the beginner likes
program music of some kind, or at least its suggestion. So it is in
literature. With those who are intellectually young, whether young
in years or not, the narrative form of expression is all in all. It
is, of course, in all the arts, a most important mode, even in
advanced stages of development. We shall never be able to do
without narrative in painting, sculpture, music and poetry; but
wherever, in a given community, the preference for this form of
expression in any art is excessive, we may be sure that
appreciation of that form of art is newly aroused. This is an
interesting symptom and a good sign. To be sure, apparent
intellectual youth may be the result of intellectual decadence;
there is a second as well as a first childhood, but it is not
difficult to distinguish between them. In general, if a large
proportion of those in a community who like to look at pictures,
prefer such as &ldquo;tell a story,&rdquo; this fact, if the number
of the appreciative <span class="pagenum"><a id="page38" name=
"page38"></a>[pg 38]</span>is at the same time increasing, means a
newly stimulated interest in art. And similarly, if a large
proportion of those persons who enjoy reading prefer the narrative
forms of literature, while at the same time their total numbers are
on the increase, this surely indicates a newly aroused interest in
books. And this is precisely the situation in which we find
ourselves to-day. A very large proportion of the literature that we
circulate is in narrative form&mdash;how large a proportion I
daresay few of us realize. Not only all the fiction, adult and
juvenile, but all the history, biography and travel, a large
proportion of literature and periodicals, some of the sciences,
including all reports of original research, and a lesser proportion
of the arts, philosophy and religion, are in this form. It may be
interesting to estimate the percentage of narrative circulated by a
large public library, and I have attempted this in the case of the
New York public library for the year ending July 1, 1906.</p>

<p>In other words, if my estimates are not too much out of the
way&mdash;and I have tried to be conservative&mdash;only 16 per
cent. of our whole circulation, and 38 per cent. of our
non-fiction, is non-narrative, despite the fact that our total
fiction percentage is low.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page39" name="page39"></a>[pg
39]</span>I attach little importance in this regard to any
distinction between true and fictitious narrative, people who read
novels do not enjoy them simply because the subject matter is
untrue. They enjoy the books because they are interesting. In fact,
in most good fiction, little beside the actual sequence of the
events in the plot and the names of the characters is untrue. The
delineation of character, the descriptions of places and events and
the statements of fact are intended to be true, and the further
they depart from truth the less enjoyable they are. Indeed, when
one looks closely into the matter, the dividing line between what
we call truth and fiction in narrative grows more and more
hazy.</p>
<p>In pictorial art we do not attempt to make it at all. Our
museums do not classify their pictures into true and imaginary. Our
novels contain so much truth and our other narrative works so much
fiction, that it is almost as difficult to draw the line in the
literary as it is in the pictorial arts. And in any case objections
to a work of fiction, as well as commendations, must be based on
considerations apart from this classification.</p>
<p>To represent a fictitious story as real or an imaginary portrait
as a true one is, of course, a fault, but the story and the
portrait may both be of the highest excellence when the subjects
are wholly imaginary. It should be noted that the crime of false
representation, when committed with success, removes a work from
library classification as fiction and places it in one of the other
classes. Indeed, it is probable that much more lasting harm is done
by false non-fiction than by fiction. The reader, provided he uses
literature temperately, has much less need to beware of the novel,
which he reads frankly for entertainment, than of the history full
of &ldquo;things <span class="pagenum"><a id="page40" name=
"page40"></a>[pg 40]</span>that are not so,&rdquo; of the biased
biography, of science &ldquo;popularized&rdquo; out of all likeness
to nature, of absurd theories in sociology or cosmology, of silly
and crude ideas masquerading as philosophy, of the out-and-out
falsehood of fake travellers and pseudo-naturalists.</p>
<p>In what has gone before it has been assumed that the reader is
temperate. One may read to excess either in fiction or non-fiction,
and the result is the same; mental over-stimulation, with the
resulting reaction. One may thus intoxicate himself with history,
psychology or mathematics&mdash;the mathematics-drunkard is the
worst of all literary debauchees when he does exist&mdash;and the
only reason why fiction-drunkenness is more prevalent is that
fiction is more attractive to the average man. We do not have to
warn the reader against over-indulgence in biography or
art-criticism, any more than we have to put away the vichy bottle
when a bibulous friend appears, or forbid the children to eat too
many shredded-wheat biscuits. Fiction has the fatal gift of being
too entertaining. The novel-writer must be interesting or he fails;
the historian or the psychologist does not often regard it as
necessary&mdash;unless he happens to be a Frenchman.</p>
<p>But with this danger of literary surfeit or over-stimulation, I
submit that the librarian has nothing to do; it is beyond his
sphere, at least in so far as he deals with the adult reader. We
furnish parks and playgrounds for our people; we police them and
see that they contain nothing harmful, but we cannot guarantee that
they will not be used to excess&mdash;that a man may not, for
example, be so enraptured with the trees and the squirrels that he
will give up to their contemplation time that should be spent in
supporting his family. So in the library we may <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page41" name="page41"></a>[pg 41]</span>and do see
that harmful literature is excluded, but we cannot be expected to
see that books which are not in themselves injurious are not
sometimes used to excess.</p>
<p>I venture to suggest that very much of our feeling of
disquietude about the large use of fiction in the public library
and elsewhere arises from our misapprehension of something that
must always force itself upon the attention in a state of society
where public education and public taste are on the increase. In
this case the growth will necessarily be uneven in different
departments of knowledge and taste, and in different localities; so
that discrepancies frequently present themselves. We may observe,
for instance, a quietly and tastefully dressed woman reading, we
will say, Laura Jean Libbey. We are disconcerted, and the effect is
depressing. But the discrepancy may arise in either of two ways. If
we have here a person formerly possessing good taste both in dress
and reading, whose taste in the latter regard has deteriorated, we
certainly have cause for sadness; but if, as is much more likely,
we have one who had formerly bad taste of both kinds and whose
taste in dress has improved, we should rather rejoice. The argument
is the same whether the change has taken place in the same
generation or in more than one. Our masses are moving upward and
the progress along the more material lines is often more rapid than
in matters of the intellect. Or, on the contrary, intellectual
progress may be in advance of manners. Such discrepancies are
frequently commented upon by foreign travelers in the United
States, who almost invariably misinterpret them in the same way.
Can we blame them, when we make the same mistake ourselves? M.
Jules Huret, in his recent interesting book &ldquo;En
Amerique,&rdquo; <span class="pagenum"><a id="page42" name=
"page42"></a>[pg 42]</span>notes frequently the lapses in manners
and taste of educated persons among us. He describes, for instance,
the bad table-manners of a certain clergyman. His thought is
evidently, &ldquo;How shocking that a clergyman should act in this
way!&rdquo; But we might also put it: &ldquo;How admirable that
professional education in this country is so easily obtained that
one of a class in which such manners prevail can secure it! How
encouraging that he should desire to enter the ministry and succeed
in doing so!&rdquo; These are extreme standpoints; we need of
course endorse neither of them. But when I find that on the upper
west side of New York, where the patrons of our branch libraries
are largely the wives and daughters of business men with good
salaries, whose general scale of living is high, the percentage of
fiction circulated is unduly great, I do not say, as I am tempted
to do &ldquo;How surprising and how discouraging that persons of
such apparent cultivation should read nothing but fiction, and that
not of the highest grade!&rdquo; I say rather: &ldquo;What an
evidence it is of our great material prosperity that persons in an
early stage of mental development, as evidenced by undue preference
for narrative in literature, are living in such comfort or even
luxury!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Is not this the right way to look at it? I confess that I can
see no reason for despairing of the American people because it
reads more fiction than it used to read, so long as this is for the
same reason that a ten year old boy reads more stories than a baby.
Intellectual youth is at least an advance over mental infancy so
long as it is first childhood&mdash;not second. It is undoubtedly
our duty, as it is our pleasure, to help these people to grow, but
we cannot force them, and should not try. Complete growth may take
several generations. And even when full stature has <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page43" name="page43"></a>[pg 43]</span>been
obtained, literature in its narrative modes, though not so
exclusively as now, will still be loved and read. Romance will
always serve as the dessert in the feast of reason&mdash;and we
should recollect that sugar is now highly regarded as a food. It is
a producer of energy in easily available form, and, thinking on
some such novels as &ldquo;Uncle Tom,&rdquo; &ldquo;Die Waffen
nieder&rdquo; and shall we say &ldquo;The jungle&rdquo;? we realize
that this thing is a parable, which the despiser of fiction may
well read as he runs.</p>

<p class="returnTOC"><a href="#Contents">Return to Table of
Contents</a></p>
<p>Man is a gregarious animal; he cannot think, act, or even exist
except in certain relations to others of his kind. For a complete
description of those relations we must go to a treatise on
sociology; our present subject is a very brief consideration of
certain groups of individuals, natural or voluntary, and the
application of the laws that govern such groups to the voluntary
associations with which we are all familiar in library work. Men
have joined together to effect certain things that they could not
accomplish singly, ever since two savages found that they could
lift a heavy log or stone together, when neither one could manage
it alone. Until recently the psychology of human groups has
received little study. Le Bon, in his book on &ldquo;The
Crowd,&rdquo; gives the modern treatment of it. A group of persons
does not think and act precisely as each of its component
individuals would think or act. The very act of association, loose
as it may be, introduces a new factor. Even the two savages lifting
the log do not work together precisely as either would have worked
singly. Their co-operation affects their activity; and both thought
and action may likewise be affected in larger groupings even by the
mere proximity of the individuals of the group, where there is no
stronger bond.</p>
<p>But although the spirit that collectively animates a group of
men cannot be calculated by taking an arithmetical sum, it does
depend on that possessed <span class="pagenum"><a id="page46" name=
"page46"></a>[pg 46]</span>by each individual in the group, and
more particularly on what is common to them all and on the nature
of the bonds that connect them. Even a chance group of persons
previously unconnected and unrelated is bound together by feelings
common to all humanity and may be appealed to collectively on such
grounds. The haphazard street crowd thrills with horror at the
sight of a baby toddling in front of a trolley-car and shouts with
joy when the motorman stops just in time. But the same crowd, if
composed of newly-arrived Poles, Hungarians and Slovaks, would fail
utterly to respond to some patriotic appeal that might move an
American crowd profoundly. You may sway a Methodist congregation
with a tale of John Wesley that would leave Presbyterians or
Episcopalians cold. Try a Yale mob with &ldquo;Boola&rdquo; and
then play the same tune at Princeton, and watch the effect.</p>
<p>Thus, the more carefully our group is selected the more
particular and definite are the motives that we can bring to bear
in it, and the more powerful will its activities be along its own
special lines. The mob in the street may be roused by working on
elemental passions&mdash;so roused it will kill or burn, but you
cannot excite in it enthusiasm for Dante&rsquo;s Inferno, or induce
it to contribute money or labor toward the preparation of a new
annotated edition. To get such enthusiasm and stimulate such action
you must work upon a body of men selected and brought together for
this very purpose.</p>
<p>Besides this, we must draw a distinction between natural and
artificial groups. The group brought together by natural causes and
not by man&rsquo;s contriving is generally lower in the scale of
civilization when it acts collectively than any one of its
components. This is the case with a mob, a tribe, even a
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page47" name="page47"></a>[pg
47]</span>municipal group. But an artificial or selected group,
where the grouping is for a purpose and has been specially effected
with that end in view may act more intelligently, and be, so far as
its special activities are concerned, more advanced in the scale of
progress than its components as individuals. There is the same
difference as between a man&rsquo;s hand and a delicate tool. The
former is the result of physical evolution only; the latter of
evolution into which the brain of man has entered as a factor. The
tool is not as good for &ldquo;all round&rdquo; use as the hand;
but to accomplish its particular object it is immeasurably
superior.</p>
<p>If, then, we are to accomplish anything by taking advantage of
the very peculiar crowd or group psychology&mdash;owing to which a
collected body of men may feel as a group and act as a group,
differently from the way in which any one of its components would
feel or act&mdash;we must see that our group is properly selected
and constituted. This does not mean that we are to go about and
choose individuals, one by one, by the exercise of personal
judgment. Such a method is generally inferior and unnecessary. If
we desire to separate the fine from the coarse grains in a
sand-pile we do not set to work with a microscope to measure them,
grain by grain; we use a sieve. The sieve will not do to separate
iron filings from copper filings of exactly the same size, but here
a magnet will do the business. And so separation or selection can
almost always be accomplished by choosing an agency adapted to the
conditions; and such agencies often act automatically without the
intervention of the human will. In a voluntary association formed
to accomplish a definite purpose we have a self-selected group.
Such a body may be freely open to the public, as all our library
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page48" name="page48"></a>[pg
48]</span>clubs and associations practically are; yet it is still
selective, for no one would care to join it who is not in some way
interested in its objects. On the other hand, the qualifications
for membership may be numerous and rigid, in which case the
selection is more limited. The ideal of efficiency in an
association is probably reached when the body is formed for a
single definite purpose and the terms of admission are so arranged
that each of its members is eager above all things to achieve its
end and is specially competent to work for it, the purpose of the
grouping being merely to attain the object more surely, thoroughly
and rapidly. A good example is a thoroughly trained military
organization, all of whose members are enthusiastic in the cause
for which the body is fighting&mdash;a band of patriots, we will
say&mdash;or perhaps a band of brigands, for what we have been
saying applies to evil as well as to good associations. The most
efficient of such bodies may be very temporary, as when three
persons, meeting by chance, unite to help each other over a wall
that none of them could scale by himself, and, having reached the
other side, separate again. The more clearly cut and definite the
purpose the less the necessity of retaining the association after
its accomplishment. The more efficient the association the sooner
its aims are accomplished and the sooner it is disbanded. Such
groups or bodies, by their very nature are affairs of small detail
and not of large and comprehensive purpose. As they broaden out
into catholicity they necessarily lose in efficiency. And even when
they are accomplishing their aims satisfactorily the very largeness
of those aims, the absence of sharp outline and clear definition,
frequently gives rise to complaint. I know of clubs and
associations that are doing an immense amount of <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page49" name="page49"></a>[pg 49]</span>good, in
some cases altering for the better the whole intellectual or moral
tone of a community, but that are the objects of criticism because
they do not act in matters of detail.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t they do something?&rdquo; is the constant
cry. And &ldquo;doing something,&rdquo; as you may presently
discover, is carrying on some small definite, relatively
unimportant activity that is capable of clear description and
easily fixes the attention, while the greater services, to the
public and to the individual, of the association&rsquo;s quiet
influences pass unnoticed. The church that has driven out of
business one corner-saloon gets more praise than the one that has
made better men and women of a whole generation in one
neighborhood; the police force that catches one sensational
murderer is more applauded than the one that has made life and
property safe for years in its community by quiet, firm
pressure.</p>
<p>There is no reason of course, why the broader and the more
definite activities may not be united, to some degree, in one
organization. Either smaller groups with related aims may federate
for the larger purpose, or the larger may itself be the primary
group, and may subdivide into sections each with its specified
object. Both these plans or a combination of the two may be seen in
many of our large organizations, and it is this combination that
seems finally to have been selected as the proper form of union for
the libraries and the librarians of the United States. We have a
large organization which, as it has grown more and more unwieldy,
has been subdivided into smaller specialized sections without
losing its continuity for its broader and perhaps vaguer work. At
the same time, specialized bodies with related aims have been
partially or wholly absorbed, until, by processes partly of
subdivision and <span class="pagenum"><a id="page50" name=
"page50"></a>[pg 50]</span>partly of accretion, we have a body
capable of dealing alike with the general and the special problems
of library work. It should not be forgotten, however, that its
success in dealing with both kinds of problems is still conditioned
by the laws already laid down. The general association, as it grows
larger, will be marked less and less by the enthusiasm of the
specialist, will be less and less efficient, will move more slowly,
will deliver its opinions with reticence and will hesitate to act
upon them. The smaller constituent bodies will be affected by none
of these drawbacks, but their purposes appeal to the few and their
actions, though more energetic, will often seem to the majority of
the larger group devoid of meaning. This is, of course, the case
with the National Educational Association, the American Association
for the Advancement of Science, and hosts of similar bodies here
and abroad. To state the difficulty is merely to confess that all
attempts hitherto have failed to form a group that is at once
comprehensive, powerful and efficient, both in the larger matters
with which it deals and in details.</p>
<p>Probably the most successful attempt of this kind is formulated
in the Constitution of the United States itself and is being
carried on in our country from day to day, yet successful as it is,
our history is witness, and the daily press testifies, that the
combination of general and local governments has its weak points
and is dependent for its smooth working on the cordial consent and
forbearance of the governed. This is true also of smaller
combinations. In our own organization it is easy to find fault, it
is easy to discover points of friction; only by the cordial effort
of every member to minimize these points can such an organization
begin to accomplish its aims. Failure is much more apt to be due to
lack <span class="pagenum"><a id="page51" name="page51"></a>[pg
51]</span>of appreciation of this fact than to any defect in the
machinery of organization. This being the case we are thrown back
upon consideration of the membership of our institution. How should
it be selected and how constituted?</p>
<p>The constitution of the association says that &ldquo;Any person
or institution engaged in library work may become a member by
paying the annual dues, and others after election by the executive
board.&rdquo; We have thus two classes of members, those by their
own choice and those by election. The annual lists of members do
not record the distinction, but among those in the latest list we
find 24 booksellers, 17 publishers, 5 editors, 9 school and college
officials, 8 government employees not in libraries, and 24 wives
and relatives of other members, while in the case of 132 persons no
qualification is stated in the list. We have or have had as our
associates, settlement workers, lawyers, lecturers, indexers,
binders, and so on almost indefinitely. Our membership is thus
freely open to librarians, interpreting this word very broadly, and
to any others that we may desire to have with us, which means,
practically, any who have sufficient interest in library work to
come to the meetings. We must, therefore, be classed with what may
be called the &ldquo;open&rdquo; as opposed to the
&ldquo;closed&rdquo; professional or technical associations. The
difference may be emphasized by a reference to two well-known New
York clubs, the Players and the Authors. These organizations would
appear by their names to be composed respectively of actors and
writers. The former, however, admits also to membership persons
interested in the drama, which may mean little or much, while the
Authors Club, despite repeated efforts to broaden it out in the
same way, has insisted on admitting none but <em>bona fide</em>
authors. In advocacy <span class="pagenum"><a id="page52" name=
"page52"></a>[pg 52]</span>of the first plan it may be said that by
adopting it the Players has secured larger membership, embracing
many men of means. Its financial standing is better and it is
enabled to own a fine club house. On the other hand, the Authors
has a small membership, and owns practically no property, but makes
up in <em>esprit de corps</em> what it lacks in these other
respects. It is another phase of the question of specialization
that we have already considered. The larger and broader body has
certain advantages, the smaller and more compact, certain others.
We have, doubtless been right in deciding, or rather in accepting
what circumstances seem to have decided for us, that our own
association shall be of the larger and less closely knit type,
following the analogy of the National Educational Association and
the various associations for the advancement of science, American,
British and French, rather than that of the Society of Civil
Engineers, for instance, or the various learned academies. Our body
has thus greater general but less special influence, just as on a
question of general scientific policy a petition from the American
association might carry greater weight, whereas on a question of
engineering it would be incomparably inferior to an opinion of the
civil engineers. There is in this country, it is true, a general
scientific body of limited membership&mdash;the National Academy of
Sciences, which speaks both on general and special questions with
expert authority. In the formation of the American Library
Institute it was sought to create some such special body of
librarians, but it is too soon to say whether or not that
expectation is to be fulfilled. The fact remains that in the
American Library Association we are committed to very nearly the
broadest plan of organization and work that is possible. We are
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page53" name="page53"></a>[pg
53]</span>united only by our connection with library work or our
interest in its success, and are thus limited in our discussions
and actions as a body to the most general problems that may arise
in this connection, leaving the special work to our sections and
affiliated societies, which are themselves somewhat hampered by our
size in the treatment of the particular subjects that come before
them, inasmuch as they are not separate groups whose freedom of
action no one can call in question.</p>
<p>In illustration of the limitations of a general body of the size
and scope of our Association, I may perhaps be allowed to adduce
the recent disagreement among librarians regarding the copyright
question, or rather regarding the proper course to be followed in
connection with the conference on that question called by the
Librarian of Congress. It will be remembered that this conference
was semi-official and was due to the desire of members of Congress
to frame a bill that should be satisfactory to the large number of
conflicting interests involved. To this conference our Association
was invited to send, and did send, delegates. It is obvious that if
these and all the other delegates to the conference had simply held
out for the provisions most favorable to themselves no agreement
would have been possible and the objects of the conference would
have been defeated. Recognizing this, all the bodies and interests
represented worked from the beginning to secure an agreement,
striving only that it should be such as would represent a minimum
of concession on all sides. This view was shared by the delegates
of this Association. The law as it stood was, it is true, most
favorable to libraries in its provisions regarding importation, and
the retention of these provisions might have been facilitated
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page54" name="page54"></a>[pg
54]</span>by withdrawal from the conference and subsequent
opposition to whatever new bill might have been framed. But the
delegates assumed that they were appointed to confer, not to
withdraw, and that if the Association had desired to hold aloof
from the conference that result would have been best attained by
appointing no delegates at all. The Association&rsquo;s delegates
accordingly joined with their fellows in the spirit of compromise
to agree on such a bill as might be least unacceptable to all, and
the result was a measure slightly, but only slightly, less
favorable to libraries than the existing law. With the presentation
of this bill to the proper committees of Congress, and a formal
statement that they approved it on behalf of the Association, the
duties of the delegates ended. And here begins to appear the
applicability of this chapter from library history to what has
preceded. The action of the delegates was officially that of the
Association. But it was disapproved by very many members of the
Association on the ground that it seemed likely to result in
lessening the importation privilege of libraries. Whether these
dissidents were in a majority or not it seemed impossible to say.
The Association&rsquo;s legislative body, the Council, twice
refused to disapprove or instruct the delegates, thus tacitly
approving their action, but the dissidents asserted that the
Council, in this respect, did not rightly reflect the opinion of
the Association. The whole situation was an instructive
illustration of the difficulty of getting a large body of general
scope to act on a definite, circumscribed question, or even of
ascertaining its opinion or its wishes regarding such action.
Recognizing this, the dissidents properly and wisely formed a
separate association with a single end in view&mdash;the retention
of present library importation privileges, and especially the
defeat of the part of the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page55"
name="page55"></a>[pg 55]</span>bill affecting such privileges as
drafted in the conference. The efforts of this body have been
crowned with success in that the bill as reported by the committee
contains a modified provision acceptable to the dissidents. Thus a
relatively small body formed for a definite purpose has quickly
accomplished that purpose, while the objects of the larger body
have been expressed but vaguely, and so far as they have been
definitely formulated have failed of accomplishment. There is a
lesson in this both for our own association and for others.</p>
<p>It must not be assumed, however, that limitation of action along
the lines I have indicated means weakness of organization. On the
contrary, foreign observers have generally testified to the
exceptional strength and efficiency of societies and groups of all
kinds in this country. It may be interesting to quote here what a
recent French writer on the United States has to say of the part
played by associations of all kinds in our national life. And, in
passing, he who is proud of his country nowadays should read what
is said of her by French and German, and even English writers. The
muck-raking is all on this side of the water. The writer from whom
I quote, M. Paul de Rousiers, author of &ldquo;La Vie
Am&eacute;ricaine,&rdquo; does not commend without discrimination,
which makes what he has to say of more value. He notes at the
outset that &ldquo;the spirit of free association is widely
extended in the United States, and it produces results of
surprising efficiency.&rdquo; There are two motives for
association, he thinks, the consciousness of weakness, which is
generally operative abroad, and the consciousness of strength,
which is our motive here. He says:</p>
<blockquote>The need of association comes generally from the
conscience of one's own feebleness or indolence.... When such
people join they add together their incapacities; hence the failure
of many <span class="pagenum"><a id="page56" name="page56"></a>[pg
56]</span> societies formed with great eclat. On the contrary, when
men accustomed to help themselves without depending on their
neighbors form an association, it is because they really find
themselves facing a common difficulty ... such persons add their
capacities; they form a powerful union of capables, the only one
that has force. Hence the general success of American
associations.</blockquote>
<p>The radical difference in the motives for association here and
in the old world was noted long ago by De Tocqueville, who
says:</p>
<blockquote>European societies are naturally led to introduce into
their midst military customs and formulas.... The members of such
associations respond to a word of command like soldiers in a
campaign; they profess the dogma of passive obedience, or rather,
by uniting, they sacrifice entirely, at a single stroke, their
judgment and free will.... In American associations, on the other
hand, individual independence finds its part; as in society every
man moves at the same time toward the same goal, but all are not
forced to go by the same road. No one sacrifices his will or his
reason, but applies them both toward the success of the common
enterprise.</blockquote>
<p>Commenting on this, De Rousiers goes on:</p>
<blockquote>This is not to say that the discipline necessary to the
pursuit of the common end is less exact than with us. As far as I
can judge, the members of an American association, on the contrary,
take their obligations more seriously than we, and precisely
because they have undertaken them very freely, without being forced
into them by environment or fashion, and also because the heads of
the association have not sought to make it serve their own
interests. In fine, their discipline is strong, but it is applied
only to one precise object; it may thus subsist intact and without
tyranny, despite the most serious divergences of view among the
members regarding objects foreign to its aim. These happy
conditions--this large and concrete mind, joined to the effective
activity of the Americans, have given rise to a multitude of groups
that are rendering the greatest service.</blockquote>
<p>De Rousiers enlarges on this point at great length and gives
many illustrations. He returns to it even when he appears to have
gone on to other subjects. In an account of a visit to a militia
encampment in Massachusetts, where he was inclined at the outset to
scoff at the lack of formal military training, but finally became
enthusiastic over the individual <span class="pagenum"><a id=
"page57" name="page57"></a>[pg 57]</span>efficiency and interest of
the militiamen, he ends by saying:</p>
<blockquote>What I have seen here resembles what I have seen
everywhere throughout the United States; each organism, each
individual, preserves all its freedom, as far as it can; hence the
limited and special character of the public authorities, to whom
little is left to do. This doubtless detracts from the massed
effects that we are in the habit of producing; we are apt to think
that this kind of liberty is only disorder; but individual efforts
are more energetic and when they converge toward a single end, by
spontaneous choice of each will, their power is incalculable. This
it is that makes the strength of America.</blockquote>
<p>An interesting and satisfactory summary. There is, however,
another way of looking at it. A well-known scientific man recently
expressed to me his conviction that an &ldquo;American&rdquo;
association of any kind is destined to failure, whether it be of
scientific men, commercial travellers or plumbers. By
&ldquo;American&rdquo; here he meant continental in extent. There
may thus be, according to this view, a successful Maine
hotel-keeper&rsquo;s association, a New York bar association, or a
Pennsylvania academy of fine arts, but no such body truly
representative of the whole United States. Many such organizations
are &ldquo;American&rdquo; or &ldquo;National&rdquo; in name only;
for instance, the &ldquo;American&rdquo; Academy of Sciences, which
is a Boston institution, or the &ldquo;National&rdquo; Academy of
Fine Arts, which belongs to New York City. Many bodies have
attempted to obviate this trouble by the creation of local sections
in different parts of the country, and the newly-formed Society of
Illuminating Engineers has, I understand, in mind the organization
of perfectly co-ordinate bodies in various parts of the country,
without any attempt to create a central body having headquarters at
a definite place. This is somewhat as if the American Library
Association should consist of the federated state associations,
perhaps with a council consisting of a single representative
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page58" name="page58"></a>[pg
58]</span>from each. It would seem to be a workable and rather
attractive plan. We may remind ourselves again that the United
States itself is the classic example of an American association,
and that it has been fairly successful by adopting this very
system. Our recognition of the necessity of local divisions in our
own association and of close affiliation with the various state
bodies is shown by the recent resolution of the council providing
for sectional meetings and by the presence at this and several
other state meetings in the present month of an official
representative of the American Library Association. That these, or
similar means of making our national body continental in something
more than name are necessary we may freely admit. Possibly it may
take some years of experimentation, ending perhaps in appropriate
constitutional revision, to hit upon the best arrangement. Too much
centralization is bad; but there must be some centralization. We
must have our capital and our legislative and administrative
machinery, as the United States has at Washington. For legislative
purposes our Washington is a shifting one. It is wherever the
Association may hold its annual meeting and wherever the Council
may convene in the interim. For such administrative and executive
purposes as require a fixed location, our Washington is for the
present in Boston. Next year it may be elsewhere; but whether it
shall remain there or move to some other place would seem to be a
matter of small importance. Wherever it may be, it will be
inaccessible to a large majority of American librarians. If
immediate accessibility is a requisite, therefore, some of its
functions may and should be divided. It may not be too much to look
forward to a sectional headquarters in every state in the Union,
related perhaps to the general <span class="pagenum"><a id="page59"
name="page59"></a>[pg 59]</span>headquarters somewhat as branch
libraries to a central library, or, perhaps, carried on under the
auspices of the state associations. At any rate, it is encouraging
to reflect that we are not insensible to the obstacles in the way
of making our own, or any other association truly American in
scope, and are experimenting toward obviating them.</p>
<p>All these considerations appear to me to lead to one
conclusion&mdash;the duty of every librarian to become and remain a
member of the American Library Association. I do not desire to
dwell on the direct advantages that membership offers&mdash;these
are not few, and they are sufficiently obvious. Possibly most of
those who are likely to be affected by them are already members of
the Association. I would recommend for consideration higher grounds
than these. Instead of asking the question, &ldquo;What is there in
it for me?&rdquo; I should inquire, &ldquo;What is there in it for
other people?&rdquo; How will it benefit the general status of
library work, the general standing of librarians in the community,
the influence of libraries on those who use or ought to use
them&mdash;these and a hundred other elements of progress that are
closely bound up with the success of library effort, but that may
not add to the welfare of any one individual.</p>
<p>There seems to be no doubt that the answers to these questions
all point toward increased membership. As we have chosen to work
along the broader lines and by the energy of mass rather than that
of velocity&mdash;with the sledge-hammer rather than the rifle
bullet&mdash;it is surely our duty to make that mass as efficient
and as impressive as possible, which means that it must be swelled
to the largest possible proportions. Large membership may be
efficient in two ways, by united weight and by pervasiveness. An
army is powerful in the first way. Ten thousand <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page60" name="page60"></a>[pg 60]</span>men
concentrated in one spot may strike a sledge-hammer blow and carry
all before them. Yet the same ten thousand men may police a great
city without even seeing one another. Scattered about on different
beats they are everywhere. Every block or two one meets a patrol
and the sense of security that they give is overwhelming. It is in
this way, it seems to me, that large membership in the American
Library Association may be effective. We meet together but once a
year, and even then we do not bring out our full force. We have no
intention of marching on Washington <em>en masse</em> to secure
legislation or even of forcing our trustees to raise salaries by a
general library strike. But if we can make it an unusual thing for
a librarian not to be a member of the American Library Association;
if wherever one goes he meets our members and recognizes what they
stand for, then, it seems to me, public opinion of librarians and
librarianship is sure to rise. Our two savages, who band together
for a few moments to lift a log, become by that act of association
marked men among their fellows; the mere fact that they have
intelligence enough to work together for any purpose raises them
above the general level. It is not alone that increasing numbers,
strength, and influence make for the glory of the Association
itself; the most successful bodies of this kind are those that
exalt, not themselves but the professions, localities or ideals
that they represent. It is because increasing our numbers and
scattering our membership throughout the land will increase the
influence of the library and strengthen the hands of those who work
in it that I believe such increase a worthy object of our effort.
Associations and societies come and go, form and disband; they are
no more immortal than the men and women that compose them.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page61" name="page61"></a>[pg
61]</span>Yet an association, like a man, should seek to do the
work that lies before it with all its strength, and to keep that
strength at its maximum of efficiency. So doing, it may rest
content that, be its accomplishment large or small, its place in
the history of human endeavor is worthy and secure.</p>

<h2><a name="Essay7" id="Essay7">Modern Educational
Methods</a></h2>
<p class="returnTOC"><a href="#Contents">Return to Table of
Contents</a></p>
<p>Those who complain that the average of general education has
been lowered are both right and wrong&mdash;right literally and
wrong in the general impression that they give. It is undoubtedly
true that among young persons with whom an educated adult comes
intellectually in contact the average of culture is lower than it
was twenty years ago. This is not, however, because the class of
persons who were well educated then are to-day less well trained,
but rather because the class has been recruited from the ignorant
classes, by the addition of persons who were not educated at all
then, or educated very slightly, and who are now receiving a
higher, though still inadequate degree of training. In other words
the average of education among all persons in the community is
higher, but the average among educated persons is lower, because
the educated class has been enlarged by the addition of large
numbers of slightly educated persons.</p>
<p>This phenomenon is common to all stages of progress in all sorts
of things. It is true, for instance, in the general advance of the
world in civilization. The average degree of appreciation of art
among persons who know anything of art at all is less, for
instance, than in the days of ancient Greece, because the class of
art-lovers throughout the world is vastly larger and includes a
very large number of persons whose appreciation of art is slight
and crude. There is, nevertheless, a greater total amount of love
for art, and a higher average of art education, taking into account
the world&rsquo;s entire population, <span class="pagenum"><a id=
"page64" name="page64"></a>[pg 64]</span>than there was then. Let
us state the case mathematically: If, of one thousand persons, ten
have a hundred dollars each and the rest nothing, a gift of five
dollars each to five hundred others will raise the average amount
owned by each of the thousand, but will greatly lower the average
amount held by the property owners in the group, who will now
number 510, instead of ten.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you demonstrate all this?&rdquo; will probably be
asked. I do not know of any statistical data that will enable it to
be proved directly, but it is certain that education is becoming
more general, which must increase the number of partly educated
persons having an imperfect educational background&mdash;a lack of
ancestral training and home influence. Thus, among the persons with
whom the educated adult comes in contact, he necessarily meets a
larger number of individuals than formerly who betray lack of
education in speech, writing or taste; and he wrongly concludes
that the schools are not doing their work properly. If the schools
were not doing their work properly, we should have direct
statistical evidence of it, and all the direct evidence I have seen
goes to show that the schools are accomplishing more to-day and
accomplishing it by better methods, than ever before.</p>
<p>Similarly, I believe that the totality of teaching ability in
the profession has increased. The conspicuous failures are persons
who are unfit to be teachers and who have been drafted into service
because of our sudden increase in educational plant. The result in
some cases has been a curious aberration in disciplinary
methods&mdash;a freakishness that is inseparable from any sudden
advance such as we are making.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page65" name="page65"></a>[pg
65]</span>Our schools can and will advance much further in
personnel, methods and results; but they are by no means on the
downward path now. One way in which they may do better work is by
greater appreciation of their selective as well as their training
function.</p>
<p>Suppose we have twenty bushels of raspberries and the same
quantity of potatoes to be prepared for food. Our present
educational methods are a good deal like those of a cook who should
try to make the whole into either jam or Saratoga chips, or should
divide the lot in some arbitrary way unrelated to their fitness for
one or the other operation. We are giving in our educational
institutions many degrees and many kinds of training without proper
selection of the persons to whom the training is to be applied.
Selection must be and is made, of course, but it is made on
arbitrary lines, or for reasons unrelated to fitness. One
boy&rsquo;s education lasts ten years, and another&rsquo;s two, not
because the former is fitted to profit by a longer period of
training, but because his father happens to have money and
inclination to give it to him. One young man studies medicine and
another goes into business, not because these are the careers for
which they are specially fitted, but because one thinks that the
prefix &ldquo;Doctor&rdquo; would look well in front of his name
and the other has a maternal uncle in the dry-goods trade.</p>
<p>I am not so foolish as to think that selection of this kind
could ever be made with unerring accuracy, but I do assert that an
effort should be made to effect it in a greater degree through our
regular educational institutions and to leave it less to chance.
Our present methods are like those of wild nature, which scatters
seeds broadcast in the hope that some <span class="pagenum"><a id=
"page66" name="page66"></a>[pg 66]</span>may settle on favoring
soil, rather than those of the skilled cultivator, who sees that
seed and soil are fitted for each other.</p>
<p>In this and other particulars I look for great improvement in
our educational methods; but I do not think that, except in local
and unessential particulars, here and there, they are now
retrograding.</p>

<p>Of the three great divisions of economics&mdash;production,
distribution and consumption&mdash;the library has to do chiefly
with the second, and it is as a distributor of literature that I
desire to speak of it, although it has its share both in the
production and consumption of books&mdash;more briefly, in the
writing and reading of them. Much writing of books is done wholly
in libraries and by their aid, and much reading is done therein.
These functions I pass by with this brief notice.</p>
<p>A library distributes books. So does a bookseller. The functions
of these two distributors, however, should differ somewhat as do
those of the two producers of books&mdash;the author and the
publisher. The author creates the soul of the book and the
publisher gives it a body. The former produces the immaterial,
possibly the eternal, part and the latter merely the material part.
Likewise, in our distribution we librarians should lay stress upon
what is in the book, upon the production of the author rather than
on that of the publisher, though we may not neglect the latter. We
are, however, eminently distributors of ideas rather than of mere
merchandise, and in so far as we lay stress on the material side of
the book&mdash;important as this is&mdash;and neglect what is in
it, we are but traders in books and not librarians.</p>
<p>Among many of the great distributors of ideas&mdash;the
magazine, the newspaper, the school&mdash;it is becoming
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page68" name="page68"></a>[pg
68]</span>increasingly difficult to find any that do not feel what
I may call an anti-civic tendency. They have come to be supported
largely by other agencies than the public, and they are naturally
controlled by those agencies. As for the public, it has become
accustomed to paying less than cost for what it gets along these
lines, and is thus becoming intellectually pauperized. It is no
more possible to distribute ideas at a profit, as a commercial
venture, nowadays, than it would have been to run a circus, with an
admission fee, in Imperial Rome. Thus a literary magazine is
possible only because it is owned by some publisher who uses it as
an advertising medium. He can afford to sell it to the public for
less than cost; the public would leave a publication sold at a fair
profit severely alone, hence such a venture is impossible. A
scientific magazine in like manner must have some one to back
it&mdash;a firm of patent-office brokers or a scientific society.
The daily papers depend almost wholly on their advertisements; the
public would not buy a simple compilation of the day&rsquo;s news
at a fair profit. Even our great institutions of higher education
give their students more than the latter pay for; the student is
getting part of his tuition for nothing. A college that depends
wholly on tuition fees for its support is soon left without
students. Thus all these disseminators of ideas are not dependent
on the persons to whom they distribute those ideas, for whose
interest it is that the ideas shall be good and true and selected
with discrimination. They depend rather for support on outside
bodies of various kinds and so tend to be controlled by
them&mdash;bodies whose interests do not necessarily coincide with
those of the public. This is not true of material things. Their
distributors still strive to please the public, for it is by the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page69" name="page69"></a>[pg
69]</span>public that they are supported. If the public wants
raspberry jam, raspberry jam it gets; and if, being aroused, it
demands that this shall be made out of raspberries instead of
apples, dock-seeds and aniline, it ultimately has its way. But if
the department store were controlled by some outside agency,
benevolent or otherwise, which partly supported it and enabled it
to sell its wares below cost, then if this controlling agency
willed that we should eat dock-seeds and aniline&mdash;dock-seeds
and aniline we should doubtless eat.</p>
<p>Not that the controlling powers in all these instances are
necessarily malevolent. The publisher who owns a literary magazine
may honestly desire that it shall be fearlessly impartial. The
learned body that runs a scientific periodical may be willing to
admit to its pages a defense of a thesis that it has condemned in
one of its meetings; the page-advertiser in a great daily may be
able to see his pet policy attacked in its editorial columns
without yielding to the temptation to bring pressure to bear; the
creator of an endowed university may view with equanimity an attack
by one of its professors on the methods by which he amassed his
wealth. All these things may be; we know in fact that they have
been and that they are. But unfortunately we all know of cases
where the effect of outside control has been quite the contrary.
The government of a benevolent despot, we are told, would be ideal;
but alas! rules for making a despot benevolent and for ensuring
that he and his successors shall remain so, are not yet formulated.
We have fallen back on the plan of fighting off the
despot&mdash;good though he may possibly be; would that we could
also abolish the non-civic control of the disseminators of
ideas!</p>
<p>Are there, then, no disseminators of ideas free <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page70" name="page70"></a>[pg 70]</span>from
interference? Yes, thank heaven, there are at least two&mdash;the
public school and the public library. Of these, the value of
academic freedom to the public school is slight, because the
training of the very young is of its nature subject little to the
influences of which we have spoken. There is little opportunity,
during a grammar school or high school course, to influence the
mind in favor of particular government policies and particular
theories in science or literature or art. This opportunity comes
later. And it is later that the public library does its best work.
Supported by the public it has no impulse and no desire to please
anyone else. No suspicion of outside control hangs over it. It
receives gifts; but they are gifts to the public, held by the
public, not by outsiders. It is tax-supported, and the public pays
cost price for what it gets&mdash;no more and no less. The
community has the power of abolishing the whole system in the
twinkling of an eye. The library&rsquo;s power in an American
municipality lies in the affections of those who use and profit by
it. It holds its position by love. No publisher may say to it:
&ldquo;Buy my books, not those of my rival&rdquo;; no scientist may
forbid it to give his opponent a hearing; no religious body may
dictate to it; no commercial influence may throw a blight over it.
It is untrammeled.</p>
<p>How long is it to remain thus? That is for its owners, the
public, to say. I confess that I feel uneasy when I realize how
little the influence of the public library is understood by those
who might try to wield that influence, either for good or for evil.
Occasionally an individual tries to use it sporadically&mdash;the
poet who tries to secure undying fame by distributing free copies
of his verses to the libraries, the manufacturer who gives us an
advertisement of <span class="pagenum"><a id="page71" name=
"page71"></a>[pg 71]</span>his product in the guise of a book, the
enthusiast who runs over our shelf list to see whether the library
is well stocked with works on his fad&mdash;socialism or
Swedenborgianism, or the &ldquo;new thought.&rdquo; But, so far,
there has been no concerted, systematic effort on the part of
classes or bodies of men to capture the public library, to dictate
its policy, to utilize its great opportunities for influencing the
public mind. When this ever comes, as it may, we must look out!</p>
<p>So far as my observation goes, the situation&mdash;even the
faintest glimmering of it&mdash;is far from dawning on most of
these bodies. Most individuals, when the policy of the library
suits them not, exhaust their efforts in an angry kick or an
epistolary curse; they never even think of trying to change that
policy, even by argument. Most of them would rather write a letter
to a newspaper, complaining of a book&rsquo;s absence, than to ask
the librarian to buy it. Organizations&mdash;civil, religious,
scientific, political, artistic&mdash;have usually let us severely
alone, where their influence, if they should come into touch with
the library, would surely be for good&mdash;would be exerted along
the line of morality, of more careful book selection, of judicial
mindedness instead of one-sidedness.</p>
<p>Let us trust that influences along this line&mdash;if we are to
have influences at all&mdash;may gain a foothold before the
opposite forces&mdash;those of sordid commercialism, of
absurdities, of falsities, of all kinds of self-seeking&mdash;find
out that we are worth their exploitation.</p>
<p>When it comes, as I expect it will some day&mdash;this general
realization of what only a few now understand&mdash;that the public
library is worth trying to influence and to exploit, our trouble
will be that we <span class="pagenum"><a id="page72" name=
"page72"></a>[pg 72]</span>shall be without any machinery at all to
receive it, to take care of it, to direct the good into proper
channels and to withstand the evil. We are occasionally annoyed and
disconcerted now by the infinitesimal amount of it that we see; we
wish people would mind their own business; we detest meddlers; we
should be able to do more work if it were not for the
bores&mdash;and so on. But what&mdash;what in heaven&rsquo;s name
shall we do with the deluge when it comes? With what dam shall we
withstand it; through what sluices shall we lead it; into what
useful turbines shall we direct it? These things are worth
pondering.</p>
<p>For the present then, this independence of the library as a
distributor may be regarded as one of its chief economic
advantages. Another is its power as a leveler, and hence as an
adjunct of democracy. Democracy is a result, not a cause, of
equality. It is natural in a community whose members resemble each
other in ability, modes of thought and mental development, just as
it is unthinkable where great natural differences racial or
otherwise, exist. If we wish to preserve democracy, therefore, we
must first maintain our community on something like a level. And we
must level it up, not down; for although a form of democracy may
exist temporarily among individuals equally ignorant or degraded,
the advent of a single person more advanced in the scale of
ability, quickly transforms it into absolutism. Similar
inequalities may result in an aristocratic r&eacute;gime. The
reason why England, with its ancient aristocracy, on the whole, is
so democratic, is that its commoners are constantly recruited by
the younger sons of its nobility, so that the whole body politic is
continually stirred and kept more homogeneous than on the
continent, where all of a noble&rsquo;s sons and daughters are
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page73" name="page73"></a>[pg
73]</span>themselves noble. This stirring or levelling process may
be effected in many ways and along many lines, but in no way better
than by popular education, as we have well understood in this
country. This is why our educational system is a bulwark of our
form of government, and this is why the public library&mdash;the
only continuous feature of that system, exercising its influence
from earliest childhood to most advanced age&mdash;is worth to the
community whatever it may cost in its most improved form. There are
enough influences at work to segregate classes in our country, and
they come to us ready-made from other countries; we may be thankful
that the public library is helping to make Americans of our
immigrants and to make uniformly cultivated and well-informed
Americans of us all.</p>
<p>Another interesting light on the functions of the printed page,
and hence of the library, is shown by the recent biological theory
that connects the phenomena of heredity with those of habit and
memory. The inheritance of ancestral characteristics, according to
this view, may be described as racial memory. To illustrate, we may
take an interesting study of a family of Danish athletes, recently
made and published in France. The members of this family, adults
and children, men and women, have all been gymnasts for over three
hundred years&mdash;no one of them would think of adopting any
other means of gaining a livelihood. It seems certain to the
scientific men who have been conducting the investigation, that not
only the physical ability to become an acrobat, but also the mental
qualities that contribute so much to success in this
occupation&mdash;pride in the acrobatic pre-eminence of the family,
courage, love of applause, and so on&mdash;have been handed down
from one generation to another, and that it has cost each
generation <span class="pagenum"><a id="page74" name=
"page74"></a>[pg 74]</span>less time and effort to acquire its
skill than its predecessor. In other words, we are told, members of
this family are born with certain predispositions&mdash;latent
ancestral memories, we may say, of the occupations of previous
generations. To make these effective, it is necessary only to
awaken them, and this may be done simply by the sight of other
persons performing gymnastic feats. These they learn in weeks,
where others, without such ancestral memories, would require months
or years.</p>
<p>Evidently this may be applied much more widely than to mere
physical skill. Few of us can boast of gymnastic ancestry, but all
of us have inherited predispositions and have ancestral memories
that make it easier for us to learn certain things and to choose
certain courses than we should find it without them. Some of these
are good; some bad. Some are useful; some injurious. It is
necessary only to awaken them to set going a train of consequences;
if not awakened, they may remain permanently dormant. How
important, therefore, are the suggestions that may serve as such
awakeners; how necessary to bring forward the useful, and to banish
the injurious ones!</p>
<p>Now of all possible agencies that may bring these
predispositions into play&mdash;that may awaken our ancestral
memories, if you choose to adopt this theory&mdash;I submit that
the book stands at the very head. For it is itself a racial record;
it may contain, in the form best suited to awaken our
predispositions, the very material which, long ages ago, was
instrumental in handing those predispositions down to us. It is in
tune with our latent memories, and it may set them vibrating more
vigorously than any merely contemporary agency.</p>
<p>Does this not place in a new and interesting light the library
and the books of which it is composed? <span class="pagenum"><a id=
"page75" name="page75"></a>[pg 75]</span>We have learned to respect
them as the records of the race and to recognize their value as
teachers and their power as energizers; in addition we now see that
they may act as fingers on invisible mental triggers. A slight
impulse&mdash;altogether trivial compared with its effect&mdash;and
off goes the gun. The discharge may carry a line to a wrecked ship,
or it may sink her with all on board.</p>
<p>We frequently hear it said of some book whose tendency is bad:
&ldquo;Well, it can&rsquo;t hurt me, anyway; I&rsquo;m
immune.&rdquo; Are you quite sure? Have you gone quite to the
bottom of those ancestral memories of yours, and are you certain
that there are none that such a book may rouse, to your harm?</p>
<p>On the other hand, does this not explain much that has always
interested the librarian; for instance, the vast popularity of
fairy tales, especially those that date back to our racial infancy?
I need dwell no further on the economic importance of the book as
viewed from this standpoint.</p>
<p>But it has also a function almost diametrically opposed to that
which we have just considered; besides harking back to what is
oldest it looks forward to what is newest. It may stir us by
awakening dim racial recollections; but it may also thrill us by
adding to the store of what is already in the mind. In fact, we
like to assimilate new ideas, to think new thoughts, to do new
acts; we like to read or hear something that we could not have
produced ourselves. When we are young and ignorant, therefore, we
like music or art or literature that appears trivial to us as we
grow older and have developed our own creative powers. A poem that
is no better than one a man might dash off himself he likes no
longer; he prefers to be confronted with something that is above
and beyond his own powers, though not above his <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page76" name="page76"></a>[pg
76]</span>comprehension. Thus, as he grows, his zone of enjoyment
shifts upward, and the library covers the whole moving field. When
Solomon John Peterkin, pen in hand, sat down to write a book, he
discovered that he hadn&rsquo;t anything to say. Happy lad! He had
before him all literature as a field of enjoyment, for all,
apparently, was beyond his creative efforts.</p>
<p>Do those of you who are musicians remember when you first
apprehended the relations between the tonic and the dominant
chords? I have heard a small boy at a piano play these alternately
for hours. Such a performance is torture to you and me; it is the
sweetest harmony to him, because it is new and has just come into
his sphere of creative power. When he is thoroughly satisfied that
he can produce the effect at will, he abandons it for something
newer and a little higher. The boy who discovers, without being
told, that the dominant chord, followed by the tonic, produces a
certain musical effect, is doing something that for him is on a par
with Wagner&rsquo;s searching the piano for those marvellous
effects of his that are often beyond technical explanation.</p>
<p>The child who reads what you think is a trivial book, re-reads
it, and reads others like it, is doing this same thing in the
domain of literature&mdash;he is following the natural course that
will bring him out at the top after a while.</p>
<p>When we distribute books, then, we distribute ideas, not only
actual, but potential. A book has in it not only the ideas that lie
on its surface, but millions of others that are tied to these by
invisible chords, of which we have touched on but a few&mdash;the
invisible ancestral memories of centuries ago, the foretastes of
future thoughts in our older selves and our posterity of centuries
hence. When we think of it, it is hard to realize that a book has
not a soul.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page77" name="page77"></a>[pg
77]</span>Gerald Stanley Lee, in his latest book, a collection of
essays on millionaires, sneers at the efforts of the rich mill
owners to improve their employees by means of libraries. Life in a
modern mill, he thinks, is so mechanical as to dull all the higher
faculties. &ldquo;Andrew Carnegie,&rdquo; he says (and he
apparently uses the name merely as that of a type), &ldquo;has been
taking men&rsquo;s souls away and giving them paper
books.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now the mills may be soul-deadening&mdash;possibly they are,
though it is hard to benumb a soul&mdash;but I will venture to say
that for every soul that Mr. Carnegie, or anyone else, has taken
away, he has created, awakened and stimulated a thousand by contact
with that almost soul&mdash;that near-soul&mdash;that resides in
books. Mr. Lee&rsquo;s books may be merely paper; mine have paper
and ink only for their outer garb; their inner warp and woof is of
the texture of spirit.</p>
<p>This is why I rejoice when a new library is opened. I thank God
for its generous donor. I clasp hands with the far-reaching
municipality that accepts and supports it. I wish good luck to the
librarians who are to care for it and give it dynamic force; I
congratulate the public whose privilege it is to use it and to
profit by it.</p>

<h2><a name="Essay9" id="Essay9">Simon Newcomb: America&rsquo;s
Foremost Astronomer</a></h2>
<p class="returnTOC"><a href="#Contents">Return to Table of
Contents</a></p>
<p>Among those in all parts of the world whose good opinion is
worth having, Simon Newcomb was one of the best known of
America&rsquo;s great men. Astronomer, mathematician, economist,
novelist, he had well-nigh boxed the compass of human knowledge,
attaining eminence such as is given to few to reach, at more than
one of its points. His fame was of the far-reaching
kind,&mdash;penetrating to remote regions, while that of some
others has only created a noisy disturbance within a narrow
radius.</p>
<p>Best and most widely known as an astronomer, his achievements in
that science were not suited for sensational exploitation. He
discovered no apple-orchards on the moon, neither did he dispute
regarding the railways on the planet Venus. His aim was to make
still more exact our knowledge of the motions of the bodies
constituting what we call the solar system, and his labors toward
this end, begun more than thirty years ago, he continued almost
until the day of his death. Conscious that his span of life was
measured by months and in the grip of what he knew to be a fatal
disease, he yet exerted himself with all his remaining energy to
complete his monumental work on the motion of the moon, and
succeeded in bringing it to an end before the final summons came.
His last days thus had in them a cast of the heroic, not less than
if, as the commander of a torpedoed battleship, he had gone down
with her, or than if he had fallen charging at the head of a
forlorn hope. It is pleasant to think that such a man <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page80" name="page80"></a>[pg 80]</span>was laid
to rest with military honors. The accident that he was a retired
professor in the United States Navy may have been the immediate
cause of this, but its appropriateness lies deeper.</p>
<p>Newcomb saw the light not under the Stars and Stripes, but in
Nova Scotia, where he was born, at the town of Wallace on March 12,
1835. His father, a teacher, was of American descent, his ancestors
having settled in Canada in 1761. After studying with his father
and teaching for some little time in his native province he came to
the United States while yet a boy of eighteen, and while teaching
in Maryland in 1854-&lsquo;56 was so fortunate as to attract, by
his mathematical ability, the attention of two eminent American
scientific men, Joseph Henry and Julius Hilgard, who secured him an
appointment as computer on the Nautical Almanac. The date of this
was 1857, and Newcomb had thus, at his death, been in Government
employ for fifty-two years. As the work of the almanac was then
carried on in Cambridge, Mass., he was enabled to enter the
Lawrence Scientific School of Harvard University, where he
graduated in 1858 and where he pursued graduate studies for three
years longer. On their completion in 1861 he was appointed a
professor of mathematics in the United States Navy, which office he
held till his death. This appointment, made when he was twenty-six
years old,&mdash;scarcely more than a boy,&mdash;is a striking
testimony to his remarkable ability as a mathematician, for of
practical astronomy he still knew little.</p>
<p>One of his first duties at Washington was to supervise the
construction of the great 26-inch equatorial just authorized by
Congress and to plan for mounting and housing it. In 1877 he became
senior professor of mathematics in the navy, and from that
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page81" name="page81"></a>[pg
81]</span>time until his retirement as a Rear Admiral in 1897 he
had charge of the Nautical Almanac office, with its large corps of
naval and civilian assistants, in Washington and elsewhere. In 1884
he also assumed the chair of mathematics and astronomy in Johns
Hopkins University, Baltimore, and he had much to to do, in an
advisory capacity, with the equipment of the Lick Observatory and
with testing and mounting its great telescope, at that time the
largest in the world.</p>
<p>To enumerate his degrees, scientific honors, and medals would
tire the reader. Among them were the degree of LL.D. from all the
foremost universities, the gold medal of the Royal Astronomical
Society of London in 1874, the great gold Huygens medal of the
University of Leyden, awarded only once in twenty years, in 1878,
and the Schubert gold medal of the Imperial Academy of St.
Petersburg. The collection of portraits of famous astronomers at
the Observatory of Pulkowa contains his picture, painted by order
of the Russian Government in 1887. He was, of course, a member of
many scientific societies, at home and abroad, and was elected in
1869 to our own National Academy of Sciences, becoming its
vice-president in 1883. In 1893 he was chosen one of the eight
foreign associates of the Institute of France,&mdash;the first
native American since Benjamin Franklin to be so chosen.
Newcomb&rsquo;s most famous work as an astronomer,&mdash;that which
gained him world-wide fame among his brother
astronomers,&mdash;was, as has been said, too mathematical and
technical to appeal to the general public among his countrymen, who
have had to take his greatness, in this regard, on trust. They have
known him at first hand chiefly as author or editor of popular
works such as his &ldquo;Popular Astronomy&rdquo; (1877); of his
text-books <span class="pagenum"><a id="page82" name=
"page82"></a>[pg 82]</span>on astronomy, algebra, geometry,
trigonometry, and calculus; of his books on political economy,
which science he was accustomed to call his
&ldquo;recreation&rdquo;; and of magazine articles on all sorts of
subjects not omitting &ldquo;psychical research,&rdquo; which was
one of the numerous by-paths into which he strayed. He held at one
time the presidency of the American Society for Psychical
Research.</p>
<p>The technical nature of his work in mathematical
astronomy,&mdash;his &ldquo;profession,&rdquo; as he called it, in
distinction to his &ldquo;recreations&rdquo; and minor scientific
amusements,&mdash;may be seen from the titles of one or two of his
papers: &ldquo;On the Secular Variations and Mutual Relations of
the Orbits of the Asteroids&rdquo; (1860); &ldquo;Investigation of
the Orbit of Neptune, with General Tables of Its Motion&rdquo;
(1867); &ldquo;Researches on the Motion of the Moon&rdquo; (1876);
and so on. Of this work Professor Newcomb himself says, in his
&ldquo;Reminiscences of an Astronomer&rdquo; (Boston, 1903), that
it all tended toward one result,&mdash;the solution of what he
calls &ldquo;the great problem of exact astronomy,&rdquo; the
theoretical explanation of the observed motions of the heavenly
bodies.</p>
<p>If the universe consisted of but two bodies,&mdash;say, the sun
and a planet,&mdash;the motion would be simplicity itself; the
planet would describe an exact ellipse about the sun, and this
orbit would never change in form, size, or position. With the
addition of only one more body, the problem at once becomes so much
more difficult as to be practically insoluble; indeed, the
&ldquo;problem of the three bodies&rdquo; has been attacked by
astronomers for years without the discovery of any general formula
to express the resulting motions. For the actually existing system
of many planets with their satellites and countless asteroids, only
an approximation is possible. The actual motions <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page83" name="page83"></a>[pg 83]</span>as
observed and measured from year to year are most complex. Can these
be completely accounted for by the mutual attractions of the
bodies, according to the law of gravitation as enunciated by Sir
Isaac Newton? In Newcomb&rsquo;s words, &ldquo;Does any world move
otherwise than as it is attracted by other worlds?&rdquo; Of
course, Newcomb has not been the only astronomer at work on this
problem, but it has been his life-work and his contributions to its
solution have been very noteworthy.</p>
<p>It is difficult to make the ordinary reader understand the
obstacles in the way of such a determination as this. Its two
elements are, of course, the mapping out of the lines in which the
bodies concerned actually do move and the calculations of the
orbits in which they ought to move, if the accepted laws of
planetary motion are true. The first involves the study of
thousands of observations made during long years by different men
in far distant lands, the discussion of their probable errors, and
their reduction to a common standard. The latter requires the use
of the most refined methods of mathematical analysis; it is, as
Newcomb says, &ldquo;of a complexity beyond the powers of ordinary
conception.&rdquo; In works on celestial mechanics a single formula
may fill a whole chapter.</p>
<p>This problem first attracted Newcomb&rsquo;s attention when a
young man at Cambridge, when by analysis of the motions of the
asteroids he showed that the orbits of these minor planets had not,
for several hundred thousand years past, intersected at a single
point, and that they could not, therefore, have resulted, during
that period, from the explosion of a single large body, as had been
supposed.</p>
<p>Later, when Newcomb&rsquo;s investigations along this line had
extended to the major planets and their <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page84" name="page84"></a>[pg
84]</span>satellites, a curious anomaly in the moon&rsquo;s motion
made it necessary for him to look for possible observations made
long before those hitherto recorded. The accepted tables were based
on observations extending back as far as 1750, but Newcomb, by
searching the archives of European observatories, succeeded in
discovering data taken as early as 1660, not, of course, with such
an investigation as this in view, but chiefly out of pure
scientific curiosity. The reduction of such observations,
especially as the old French astronomers used apparent time, which
was frequently in error by quarter of an hour or so, was a matter
of great difficulty. The ancient observer, having no idea of the
use that was to be made of his work, had supplied no facilities for
interpreting it, and &ldquo;much comparison and examination was
necessary to find out what sort of an instrument was used, how the
observations were made, and how they should be utilized for the
required purpose.&rdquo; The result was a vastly more accurate
lunar theory than had formerly been obtained.</p>
<p>During the period when Newcomb was working among the old papers
of the Paris Observatory, the city, then in possession of the
Communists, was beset by the national forces, and his studies were
made within hearing of the heavy siege guns, whose flash he could
even see by glancing through his window.</p>
<p>Newcomb&rsquo;s appointment as head of the Nautical Almanac
office greatly facilitated his work on the various phases of this
problem of planetary motions. Their solution was here a legitimate
part of the routine work of the office, and he had the aid of able
assistants,&mdash;such men as G.W. Hill, who worked out a large
part of the theory of Jupiter and Saturn, and Cleveland Keith, who
died in 1896, just as the final results of his work were being
combined. In <span class="pagenum"><a id="page85" name=
"page85"></a>[pg 85]</span>connection with this work Professor
Newcomb strongly advocated the unification of the world&rsquo;s
time by the adoption of an international meridian, and also
international agreement upon a uniform system of data for all
computations relating to the fixed stars. The former still hangs
fire, owing to mistaken &ldquo;patriotism&rdquo;; the latter was
adopted at an international conference held in Paris in 1896, but
after it had been carried into effect in our own Nautical Almanac,
professional jealousies brought about a modification of the plan
that relegated the improved and modernized data to an appendix.</p>
<p>Professor Newcomb&rsquo;s retirement from active service made
the continuance of his great work on an adequate scale somewhat
problematical, and his data on the moon&rsquo;s motion were laid
aside for a time until a grant from the newly organized Carnegie
Institution in 1903 enabled him to employ the necessary assistance,
and the work has since gone forward to completion.</p>
<p>What is the value of such work, and why should fame be the
reward of him who pursues it successfully? Professor Newcomb
himself raises this question in his &ldquo;Reminiscences,&rdquo;
and without attempting to answer it directly he notes that every
civilized nation supports an observatory at great annual expense to
carry on such research, besides which many others are supported by
private or corporate contributions. Evidently the consensus of
public opinion must be that the results are worth at least a part
of what they cost. The question is included in the broader one of
the value of all research in pure science. Speaking generally, the
object of this is solely to add to the sum of human knowledge,
although not seldom some application to man&rsquo;s physical needs
springs unexpectedly from the resulting discoveries, <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page86" name="page86"></a>[pg 86]</span>as in the
case of the dynamo or that of wireless telegraphy. Possibly a more
accurate description of the moon&rsquo;s motion is unlikely to
bring forth any such application, but those who applaud the
achievements of our experts in mathematical astronomy would be
quick to deny that their fame rests on any such possibility.</p>
<p>Passing now to Professor Newcomb&rsquo;s
&ldquo;recreation,&rdquo; as he called, it,&mdash;political
economy, we may note that his contributions to it were really
voluminous, consisting of papers, popular articles and several
books, including &ldquo;The A B C of Finance&rdquo; (1877) and
&ldquo;Principles of Political Economy&rdquo; (1886). Authorities
in the science never really took these as seriously as they
deserved, possibly because they regarded Professor Newcomb as
scarcely orthodox. Some of his distinctions, however, are of
undoubted value and will live; for instance, that between the fund
and the flux of wealth, on which he insists in his treatises on
finance. As to Professor Newcomb&rsquo;s single excursion into
fiction, a romance entitled &ldquo;His Wisdom the Defender,&rdquo;
it is perhaps sufficient to say that, like everything he attempted,
it is at least worth notice. It is a sort of cross between Jules
Verne and Bulwer Lytton&rsquo;s &ldquo;Coming Race.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Professor Newcomb&rsquo;s mind was comprehensive in its
activity. One might have thought that an intellect occupied to the
last in carrying out one of the most stupendous tasks ever
attempted by a mathematical astronomer would have had little time
or little energy left for other things; but Newcomb took his rest
and pleasure in popular articles and interviews. Only a short time
before his death he published an essay on aeronautics that
attracted wide attention, drawing the conclusions that the
aeroplane can never be of much use either as a passenger-carrier or
in war, but that the dirigible balloon may <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page87" name="page87"></a>[pg 87]</span>accomplish
something within certain lines, although it will never put the
railways and steamships out of business. In particular, he treated
with unsparing ridicule the panic fear of an aerial invasion that
so lately seized upon our transatlantic cousins.</p>
<p>Personally, Newcomb was an agreeable companion and a faithful
friend. His success was due largely to his tenacity of purpose. The
writer&rsquo;s only personal contact with him came through the
&ldquo;Standard Dictionary,&rdquo;&mdash;of whose definitions in
physical science Newcomb had general oversight. On one occasion he
came into the office greatly dissatisfied with the definition that
we had framed for the word &ldquo;magnet.&rdquo;&mdash;a conception
almost impossible to define in any logical way. We had simply
enumerated the properties of the thing,&mdash;a course which in the
absence of authoritative knowledge of their causes was the only
rational procedure. But Newcomb&rsquo;s mind demanded a logical
treatment, and though he must have seen from the outset that this
was a forlorn hope, his tenacity of purpose kept him, pencil in
hand, writing and erasing alternately for an hour or more. Finally
he confessed that he could do no better than the following pair of
definitions,&mdash;&rdquo;<em>Magnet</em>, a body capable of
exerting magnetic force,&rdquo; and &ldquo;<em>Magnetic Force</em>,
the force exerted by a magnet.&rdquo; With a hearty laugh at this
beautiful <em>circulus in definiendo</em> he threw down his pencil,
and the imperfect and illogical office definition was accepted.</p>
<p>Logical as he was, however, he was in no sense bound by
convention. His economics, as has been said, was often unorthodox,
and even in his mathematical text-books he occasionally shocked the
hide-bound. I well remember an interesting discussion among members
of the Yale mathematical faculty just after the appearance of
Newcomb&rsquo;s text-book of geometry, in which he was unsparingly
condemned <span class="pagenum"><a id="page88" name=
"page88"></a>[pg 88]</span>by some because he assumed in certain
elementary demonstrations that geometrical figures could be removed
from the paper, turned over and laid down again,&mdash;the
so-called &ldquo;method of superposition,&rdquo; now generally
regarded as quite allowable. Of course, a figure can be treated in
this way only in imagination and for this season, probably, the
method was not employed by Euclid. Its use, however, leads always
to true results, as anyone may see; and it was quite characteristic
of Professor Newcomb that he should have taken it up, not having
the fear of the Greek geometers before him.</p>
<p>Such was Newcomb; it will be long before American science sees
his equal. Mathematical genius is like an automobile,&mdash;it is
looked upon in two opposing fashions as one has it or has it not. A
noted educator not long ago announced his belief that the
possession of a taste for mathematics is an exact index of the
general intellectual powers. Not much later, another eminent
teacher asserted that mathematical ability is an exotic,&mdash;that
one may, and often does, possess it who is in other respects
practically an imbecile. This is scarcely a subject in which a
single illustration decides, but surely Newcomb&rsquo;s career
justifies the former opinion rather than the latter; the amount and
kind of his mental abilities along all lines seemed to run parallel
to his mathematical genius, to resemble it in quantity and in
kind.</p>
<p>The great volumes of astronomical tables without which no
astronomer may now venture upon a computation are his best
monument; yet the general reader will longer remember, perhaps, the
lucid expositor, the genial essayist, the writer of one of the most
readable autobiographies of our day.</p>

<p>Are books fitted to be our companions? That depends. You and I
read them with pleasure; others do not care for them; to some the
reading of any book at all is as impossible as the perusal of a
volume in Old Slavonic would be to most of us. These people simply
do not read at all. To a suggestion that he supplement his usual
vacation sports by reading a novel, a New York police
captain&mdash;a man with a common school education&mdash;replied,
&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ve never read a book yet, and I don&rsquo;t
think I&rsquo;ll begin now.&rdquo; Here was a man who had never
read a book, who had no use for books, and who could get along
perfectly well without them. He is not a unique type. Hundreds of
thousands of our fellow citizens might as well be quite illiterate,
so far as the use that they make of their ability to read is
concerned. These persons are not all uneducated; they possess and
are still acquiring much knowledge, but since leaving school they
have acquired it chiefly by personal experience and by word of
mouth. Is it possible that they are right? May it be that to read
books is unnecessary and superfluous?</p>
<p>There has been some effort of late to depreciate the
book&mdash;to insist on its inadequacy and on the impracticality of
the knowledge that it conveys. &ldquo;Book-learning&rdquo; has
always been derided more or less by so-called &ldquo;practical
men&rdquo;. A recent series of comic pictures in the newspapers
makes this clear. It is about &ldquo;Book-taught Bilkins&rdquo;.
Bilkins tries to do <span class="pagenum"><a id="page90" name=
"page90"></a>[pg 90]</span>everything by a book. He raises
vegetables, builds furniture, runs a chicken farm, all by the
directions contained in books, and meets with ignominious failure.
He makes himself, in fact, very ridiculous in every instance and
thousands of readers laugh at him and his absurd books. They
inwardly resolve, doubtless, that they will be practical and will
pay no attention to books. Are they right? Is the information
contained in books always useless and absurd, while that obtained
by experience or by talking to one&rsquo;s neighbor is always
correct and valuable?</p>
<p>Many of our foremost educators are displeased with the book.
They are throwing it aside for the lecture, for laboratory work,
for personal research and experiment. Does this mean that the book,
as a tool of the teacher, will have to go?</p>
<p>What it all certainly does mean is that we ought to pause a
minute and think about the book, about what it does and what it can
not do. This means that we ought to consider a little the whole
subject of written as distinguished from spoken language. Why
should we have two languages&mdash;as we practically do&mdash;one
to be interpreted by the ear and the other by the eye? Could we or
should we abandon either? What are the advantages and what the
limitations of each? We are so accustomed to looking upon the
printed page, to reading newspapers, books, and advertisements, to
sending and receiving letters, written or typewritten, that we are
apt to forget that all this is not part of the natural order,
except in the sense that all inventions and creations of the human
brain are natural. Written language is a conscious invention of
man; spoken language is a development, shaped by his needs and
controlled by his sense of what is fitting, but not at the outset
consciously devised.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page91" name="page91"></a>[pg
91]</span>We are apt to think of written language as simply a means
of representing spoken language to the eye; but it is more than
this; originally, at least in many cases, it was not this at all.
The written signs represented not sounds, but ideas themselves; if
they were intended to correspond directly with anything, it was
with the rude gestures that signified ideas and had nothing to do
with their vocal expression. It was not until later that these
written symbols came to correspond to vocal sounds and even to-day
they do so imperfectly; languages that are largely phonetic are the
exception. The result is, as I have said, that we have two
languages&mdash;a spoken and a written. What we call reading aloud
is translation from the written to the spoken tongue; while writing
from dictation is translation from the spoken to the written. When
we read, as we say, &ldquo;to ourselves,&rdquo; we sometimes, if we
are not skilful, pronounce the spoken words under our breath, or at
least form them with our vocal organs. You all remember the story
of how the Irishman who could not read made his friend stop up his
ears while reading a letter aloud, so that he might not hear it.
This anecdote, like all good comic stories, has something in it to
think about. The skilful reader does not even imagine the spoken
words as he goes. He forgets, for the moment, the spoken tongue and
translates the written words and phrases directly into the ideas
for which they stand. A skilful reader thus takes in the meaning of
a phrase, a sentence, even of a paragraph, at a glance. Likewise
the writer who sets his own thoughts down on paper need not voice
them, even in imagination; he may also forget all about the spoken
tongue and spread his ideas on the page at first hand. This is not
so common because one writes slower than he speaks, whereas he
reads <span class="pagenum"><a id="page92" name="page92"></a>[pg
92]</span>very much faster. The swift reader could not imagine that
he was speaking the words, even if he would; the pace is too
incredibly fast.</p>
<p>Our written tongue, then, has come to be something of a language
by itself. In some countries it has grown so out of touch with the
spoken tongue that the two have little to do with each other. Where
only the learned know how to read and write, the written language
takes on a learned tinge; the popular spoken tongue has nothing to
keep it steady and changes rapidly and unsystematically. Where
nearly all who speak the language also read and write it, as in our
own country, the written tongue, even in its highest literary
forms, is apt to be much more familiar and colloquial, but at the
same time the written and the spoken tongue keep closer together.
Still, they never accurately correspond. When a man &ldquo;talks
like a book,&rdquo; or in other words, uses such language that it
could be printed word for word and appear in good literary form, we
recognize that he is not talking ordinary colloquial
English&mdash;not using the normal spoken language. On the other
hand, when the speech of a southern negro or a down-east Yankee is
set down in print, as it so often is in the modern &ldquo;dialect
story,&rdquo; we recognize at once that although for the occasion
this is written language, it is not normal literary English. It is
most desirable that the two forms of speech shall closely
correspond, for then the written speech gets life from the spoken
and the spoken has the written for its governor and controller; but
it is also desirable that each should retain more or less
individuality, and fortunately it is almost impossible that they
should not do so.</p>
<p>We must not forget, therefore, that our written speech is not
merely a way of setting down our <span class="pagenum"><a id=
"page93" name="page93"></a>[pg 93]</span>spoken speech in print.
This is exactly what our friends the spelling reformers appear to
have forgotten. The name that they have given to what they propose
to do, indicates this clearly. When a word as written and as spoken
have drifted apart, it is usually the spoken word that has changed.
Reform, therefore, would be accomplished by restoring the old
spoken form. Instead of this, it is proposed to change the written
form. In other words, the two languages are to be forced together
by altering that one of them that is by its essence the most
immutable. Where the written word has been corrupted as in spelling
&ldquo;guild&rdquo; for &ldquo;gild,&rdquo; the adoption of the
simpler spelling is a reform; otherwise, not.</p>
<p>Now is the possession of two languages, a spoken and a written,
an advantage or not? With regard to the spoken tongue, the question
answers itself. If we were all deaf and dumb, we could still live
and carry on business, but we should be badly handicapped. On the
other hand, if we could neither read nor write, we should simply be
in the position of our remote forefathers or even of many in our
own day and our own land. What then is the reasons for a separate
written language, beyond the variety thereby secured, by the use of
two senses, hearing and sight, instead of only one?</p>
<p>Evidently the chief reason is that written speech is eminently
fitted for preservation. Without the transmittal of ideas from one
generation to another, intellectual progress is impossible. Such
transmittal, before the invention of writing, was effected solely
by memory. The father spoke to the son, and he, remembering what
was said, told it, in turn, to the grandson. This is tradition,
sometimes marvellously accurate, but often untrustworthy. And as it
is without check, there is no way of telling whether a <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page94" name="page94"></a>[pg 94]</span>given
fact, so transmitted, is or is not handed down faithfully. Now we
have the phonograph for preserving and accurately reproducing
spoken language. If this had been invented before the introduction
of written language, we might never have had the latter; as it is,
the device comes on the field too late to be a competitor with the
book in more than a very limited field. For preserving particular
voices, such as those of great men, or for recording intonation and
pronunciation, it fills a want that writing and printing could
never supply.</p>
<p>For the long preservation of ideas and their conveyance to a
human mind, written speech is now the indispensable vehicle. And,
as has been said, this is how man makes progress. We learn in two
ways: by undergoing and reflecting on our own experiences and by
reading and reflecting on those of others. Neither of these ways is
sufficient in itself. A child bound hand and foot and confined in a
dark room would not be a fit subject for instruction, but neither
would he reach a high level if placed on a desert island far from
his kind and forced to rely solely on his own experiences. The
experiences of our forebears, read in the light of our own; the
experiences of our forebears, used as a starting-point from which
we may move forward to fresh fields&mdash;these we must know and
appreciate if we are to make progress. This means the book and its
use.</p>
<p>Books may be used in three ways&mdash;for information, for
recreation, for inspiration. There are some who feel inclined to
rely implicitly on the information that is to be found in
books&mdash;to believe that a book can not lie. This is an
unfortunate state of mind. The word of an author set down in print
is worth no more than when he gives it to us in spoken
language&mdash;no more and no less. There was, to be <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page95" name="page95"></a>[pg 95]</span>sure, a
time when the printed word implied at least care and
thoughtfulness. It is still true that the book implies somewhat
more of this than the newspaper, but the difference between the two
is becoming unfortunately less. Now a wrong record, if it purports
to be a record of facts, is worse than none at all. The man who
desires to know the distance between two towns in Texas and is
unable to find it in any book of reference may obtain it at the
cost of some time and trouble; but if he finds it wrongly recorded,
he accepts the result and goes away believing a lie. If we are to
use books for information, therefore, it is of the utmost
consequence that we know whether the information is correct or not.
A general critical evaluation of all literature, even on this score
alone, without going into the question of literary merit, is
probably beyond the possibilities, although it has been seriously
proposed. Some partial lists we have, and a few lists of those
lists, so that we may know where to get at them. There are many
books about books, especially in certain departments of history,
technology, or art, but no one place to which a man may go, before
he begins to read his book, to find out whether he may believe what
he reads in it. This is a serious lack, especially as there is more
than one point of view. Books that are of high excellence as
literature may not be at all accurate. How shall the boy who hears
enthusiastic praise of Prescott&rsquo;s histories and who is
spellbound when he reads them know that the results of recent
investigation prove that those histories give a totally incorrect
idea of Mexico and Peru? How is the future reader of Dr.
Cook&rsquo;s interesting account of the ascent of Mount McKinley to
know that it has been discredited? And how is he to know whether
other interesting and well-written histories and books of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page96" name="page96"></a>[pg
96]</span>travel have not been similarly proved inaccurate? At
present, there is no way except to go to one who knows the
literature of the subject, or to read as many other books on the
subject as can be obtained, weighing one against the other and
coming to one&rsquo;s own conclusions. Possibly the public library
may be able to help. Mr. Charles F. Lummis of the Los Angeles
library advocates labelling books with what he calls &ldquo;Poison
Labels&rdquo; to warn the reader when they are inaccurate or
untrustworthy. Most librarians have hesitated a little to take so
radical a step as this, not so much from unwillingness to assume
the duty of warning the public, as from a feeling that they were
not competent to undertake the critical evaluation of the whole of
the literature of special subjects. The librarian may know that
this or that book is out of date or not to be depended on, but
there are others about which he is not certain or regarding which
he must rely on what others tell him. And he knows that expert
testimony is notoriously one-sided. It is this fear of acting as an
advocate instead of as a judge that has generally deterred the
librarian from labelling his books with notes of advice or
warning.</p>
<p>There is, however, no reason why the librarian should take sides
in the matter. He may simply point out to the reader that there are
other books on the same subject, written from different points of
view, and he may direct attention to these, letting the reader draw
his own conclusions. There is probability that the public library
in the future will furnish information and guidance of this kind
about books, more than it has done in the past.</p>
<p>And here it may be noted in passing that the library is coming
out of its shell. It no longer holds itself aloof, taking good care
of its books and taking <span class="pagenum"><a id="page97" name=
"page97"></a>[pg 97]</span>little care of the public that uses
them. It is coming to realize that the man and the book are
complementary, that neither is much without the other, and that to
bring them together is its duty. It realizes also that a book is
valuable, not because it is so much paper and ink and thread and
leather, but because it records and preserves somebody&rsquo;s
ideas. It is the projection of a human mind across space and across
time and where it touches another human mind those minds have come
into contact just as truly and with as valuable results as if the
bodies that held them stood face to face in actual converse. This
is the miracle of written speech&mdash;a miracle renewed daily in
millions of places with millions of readers.</p>
<p>We have, in the modern library, the very best way of
perpetuating such relations as this and of ensuring that such as
are preserved shall be worth preserving. When the ancients desired
to make an idea carry as far as possible, they saw to the toughness
and strength of the material object constituting the record; they
cut it in stone or cast it in metal, forgetting that all matter is
in a state of continual flux and change; it is the idea only that
endures. Stone and metal will both one day pass away and unless
some one sees fit to copy the inscription on a fresh block or
tablet, the record will be lost. It is, then, only by continual
renewal of its material basis that a record in written language can
be made to last, and there is no reason why this renewal should not
take place every few years, as well as every few centuries. There
is even an advantage in frequent renewal; for this ensures that the
value of the record shall be more frequently passed upon and
prevents the preservation of records that are not worth keeping.
This preservation by frequent renewal is just what is taking place
with books; we make them of <span class="pagenum"><a id="page98"
name="page98"></a>[pg 98]</span>perishable materials; if we want to
keep them, we reprint them; otherwise they decay and are
forgotten.</p>
<p>We should not forget that by this plan the reader is usually
made the judge of whether a book is worth keeping. Why do we
preserve by continual reprinting Shakespeare and Scott and Tennyson
and Hawthorne? The reprinting is done by publishers as a
money-making scheme. It is profitable to them because there is a
demand for those authors. If we cease to care for them and prefer
unworthy writers, Shakespeare and Scott will decay and be forgotten
and the unworthy ones will be preserved. Thus a great
responsibility is thrown upon readers; so far they have judged
pretty well.</p>
<p>Just now, however, we are confining ourselves to the use of
books for information; and here there is less preservation than
elsewhere. Especially in science, statements and facts quickly
become out of date; here it is not the old but the new that we
want&mdash;the new based on the accurate and enduring part of the
old.</p>
<p>Before we leave this part of the subject it may be noted that
many persons have no idea of the kinds of information that may be
obtained from books. Even those who would unhesitatingly seek a
book for data in history, art, or mathematics would not think of
going to books for facts on plumbing, weaving, or shoe-making, for
methods of shop-window decoration or of display-advertising, for
special forms of bookkeeping suitable for factories or for
stock-farms&mdash;for a host of facts relating to trades,
occupations, and business in general. Yet there are books about all
these things&mdash;not books perhaps to read for an idle hour, but
books full of meat for them who want just this kind of food. If
Book-taught Bilkins fails, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page99"
name="page99"></a>[pg 99]</span>after trying to utilize what such
books have taught him, it is doubtless because he has previously
failed to realize that books plus experience, or, to put it
differently, the recorded experience of others plus our own is
better than either could be separately. And the same is true of
information that calls for no physical action to supplement it.
Books plus thought&mdash;the thoughts of others plus our
own&mdash;are more effective in combination than either could be by
itself. Reading should provoke thought; thought should suggest more
reading, and so on, until others&rsquo; thoughts and our own have
become so completely amalgamated that they are our personal
intellectual possessions.</p>
<p>But we may not read for information at all&mdash;recreation may
be what we are after. Do not misunderstand me. Many persons have an
idea that if one reads to amuse himself he must necessarily read
novels. I think most highly of good novels. Narrative is a popular
form of literary expression; it is used by those who wish to
instruct as well as to amuse. One may obtain plenty of information
from novels&mdash;often in a form nowhere else available. If we
want exact statement, statistical or otherwise, we do not go to
fiction for it; but if we wish to obtain what is often more
important&mdash;accurate and lasting general impressions of
history, society, or geography, the novel is often the only place
where these may be had. Likewise, one may amuse himself with
history, travel, science, or art&mdash;even with mathematics. The
last is rarely written primarily to amuse, although we have such a
title as &ldquo;Mathematical recreations,&rdquo; but there are
plenty of non-fiction books written for entertainment and one may
read for entertainment any book whatever. The result depends not so
much on the book or its contents as on the reader.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page100" name="page100"></a>[pg
100]</span>Recreation is now recognized as an essential part of
education. And just as physical recreation consists largely in the
same muscular movements that constitute work, only in different
combinations and with different ends in view, so mental recreation
consists of intellectual exercise with a similar variation of
combinations and aims.</p>
<p>Somebody says that &ldquo;play is work that you don&rsquo;t have
to do&rdquo;. So reading for amusement may closely resemble
study&mdash;the only difference is that it is purely voluntary.
Here again, however, the written language is only an intermediary;
we have as before, the contact of two minds&mdash;only here it is
often the lighter contact of good-fellowship. And one who reads
always for such recreation is thus like the man who is always
bandying trivialities, story-telling, and jesting&mdash;an
excellent, even a necessary, way of passing part of one&rsquo;s
time, but a mistaken way of employing all of it.</p>
<p>The best kind of recreation is gently stimulating, but
stimulation may rise easily to abnormality. There are fiction
drunkards just as there are persons who take too much alcohol or
too much coffee. In fact, if one is so much absorbed by the ideas
that he is assimilating that the process interferes with the
ordinary duties of life, he may be fairly sure that it is injuring
him. If one loves coffee or alcohol, or even candy, so dearly that
one can not give it up, it is time to stop using it altogether. If
a reader is so fond of an exciting story that he can not lay it
aside, so that he sits up late at night reading it, or if he can
not drop it from his mind when he does lay it aside, but goes on
thinking about the deadly combat between the hero and Lord William
Fitz Grouchy when he ought to be studying his lessons or attending
to his business, it is time to cut out fiction altogether. This
advice has absolutely nothing to do <span class="pagenum"><a id=
"page101" name="page101"></a>[pg 101]</span>with the quality of the
fiction. It will not do simply to warn the habitual drunkard that
he must be careful to take none but the best brands; he must drop
alcohol altogether. If you are a fiction drunkard, enhanced quality
will only enslave you further. This sort of use is no more
recreation in the proper sense of the word than is gambling, or
drinking to excess, or smoking opium.</p>
<p>And now we come to a use of books that is more
important&mdash;lies more at the root of things&mdash;than their
use for either information or recreation&mdash;their use for
inspiration. One may get help and inspiration along with the other
two&mdash;reading about how to make a box may inspire a boy to go
out and make one himself. It is this kind of thing that should be
the final outcome of every mental process. Nothing that goes on in
the brain is really complete until it ends in a motor stimulus. The
action, it is true, may not follow closely; it may be the result of
years of mental adjustment; it may even take place in another body
from the one where it originated. The man who tells us how to make
a box, and tells it so fascinatingly that he sets all his readers
to box-making, presumably has made boxes with his own hands, but
there may be those who are fitted to inspire action in others
rather than to undertake it themselves. And the larger literature
of inspiration is not that which urges to specific deeds like
box-making, or even to classes of deeds, like caring for the sick
or improving methods of transportation; rather does it include in
its scope all good thoughts and all good actions. It makes better
men and women of those who read it; it is revolutionary and
evolutionary at the same time, in the best sense of both words.</p>
<p>What will thus inspire me, do you ask? It would be easy to try
to tell you; it would also be easy to fail. Many have tried and
failed. This is a deeply <span class="pagenum"><a id="page102"
name="page102"></a>[pg 102]</span>personal matter. I can not tell
what book, or what passage in a book, will touch the magic spring
that shall make your life useful instead of useless, that shall
start your thoughts and your deeds climbing up instead of
grovelling or passively waiting. Only search will reveal it. The
diamond-miner who expects to be directed to the precise spot where
he will find a gem will never pick one up. Only he who seeks,
finds. There are, however, places to look and places to avoid. The
peculiar clay in which diamonds occur is well known to
mineralogists. He who runs across it, looks for diamonds, though he
may find none. But he who hunts for them on the rock-ribbed hills
of New Hampshire or the sea-sands of Florida is doing a foolish
thing&mdash;although even there he may conceivably pick up one that
has been dropped by accident.</p>
<p>So you may know where it is best to go in your search for
inspiration from books, for we know where seekers in the past have
most often found it. He who could read the Bible or Shakespeare
without finding some of it is the exception. It may be looked for
in the great poets&mdash;Homer, Virgil, Dante, Chaucer, Milton,
Hugo, Keats, Goethe; or the great historians&mdash;Tacitus,
Herodotus, Froissart, Macaulay, Taine, Bancroft; or in the great
travellers from Sir John Mandeville down, or in biographies like
Boswell&rsquo;s life of Johnson, or in books of
science&mdash;Laplace, Lagrange, Darwin, Tyndall, Helmholtz; in the
lives of the great artists; in the great novels and
romances&mdash;Thackeray, Balzac, Hawthorne, Dickens, George Eliot.
Yet each and all of these may leave you cold and may pick up your
gem in some out-of-the-way corner where neither you nor anyone else
would think of looking for it.</p>
<p>Did you ever see a car-conductor fumbling about <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page103" name="page103"></a>[pg 103]</span>in the
dark with the trolley pole, trying to hit the wire? While he is
pulling it down and letting it fly up again, making fruitless dabs
in the air, the car is dark and motionless; in vain the motorman
turns his controller, in vain do the passengers long for light. But
sooner or later the pole strikes the wire; down it flows the
current that was there all the time up in the air; in a jiffy the
car is in motion and ablaze with light. So your search for
inspiration in literature may be long and unsuccessful; you are
dark and motionless. But the life-giving current from some great
man&rsquo;s brain is flowing through some book not far away. One
day you will make the connection and your life will in a trice be
filled with light and instinct with action.</p>
<p>And before we leave this subject of inspiration, let us dwell
for a moment on that to be obtained from one&rsquo;s literary
setting in general&mdash;from the totality of one&rsquo;s literary
associations and impressions, as distinguished from that gained
from some specific passage or idea.</p>
<p>It has been said that it takes two to tell the truth; one to
speak and one to listen. In like manner we may say that two persons
are necessary to a great artistic interpretation&mdash;one to
create and one to appreciate. And of no art is this more true than
it is of literature. The thought that we are thus cooperating with
Shakespeare and Schiller and Hugo in bringing out the full effect
of their deathless conceptions is an inspiring one and its
consideration may aid us in realizing the essential oneness of the
human race, so far as its intellectual life is concerned.</p>
<p>Would you rather be a citizen of the United States than, we will
say, of Nicaragua? You might be as happy, as well educated, as well
off, there as <span class="pagenum"><a id="page104" name=
"page104"></a>[pg 104]</span>here. Why do you prefer your present
status? Simply and solely because of associations and
relationships. If this is sentiment, as it doubtless is, it is the
kind of sentiment that rules the world&mdash;it is in the same
class as friendship, loyalty, love of kin, affection for home. The
links that bind us to the past and the threads that stretch out
into the future are more satisfactory to us here in the United
States, with the complexity of its interests for us, than they
would be in Nicaragua, or Guam, or Iceland.</p>
<p>Then of what country in the realm of literature do you desire to
be a citizen? Of the one where Shakespeare is king and where your
familiar and daily speech is with the great ones of this
earth&mdash;those whose wise, witty, good, or inspiring words,
spoken for centuries past, have been recorded in books? Or would
you prefer to dwell with triviality and banality&mdash;perhaps with
Laura Jean Libbey or even with Mary J. Holmes, and those a little
better than these&mdash;or a little worse.</p>
<p>I am one of those who believe in the best associations, literary
as well as social. And associations may have their effect even if
they are apparently trivial or superficial.</p>
<p>When the open-shelf library was first introduced we were told
that one of its chief advantages was that it encouraged
&ldquo;browsing&rdquo;&mdash;the somewhat aimless rambling about
and dipping here and there into a book. Obviously this can not be
done in a closed-shelf library. But of late it has been suggested,
in one quarter or another, that although this may be a pleasant
occupation to some, or even to most, it is not a profitable one.
Opponents of the open shelf of whom there are still one or two,
here and there, find in this conclusion a reason for negativing the
argument in its favor, while those of its advocates <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page105" name="page105"></a>[pg 105]</span>who
accept this view see in it only a reason for basing that argument
wholly on other grounds.</p>
<p>Now those of us who like a thing do not relish being told that
it is not good for us. We feel that pleasure was intended as an
outward sign of benefits received and although it may in abnormal
conditions deceive us, we are right in demanding proof before
distrusting its indications. When the cow absorbs physical
nutriment by browsing, she does so without further reason than that
she likes it. Does the absorber of mental pabulum from books argue
wrongly from similar premises?</p>
<p>Many things are hastily and wrongly condemned because they do
not achieve certain results that they were not intended to achieve.
And in particular, when a thing exists in several degrees or
grades, some one of those grades is often censured, although good
in itself, because it is not a grade or two higher. Obviously
everything depends on what is required. When a shopper wants just
three yards of cloth, she would be foolish to buy four. She would,
of course, be even more foolish to imagine that, if she really
wished four, three would do just as well. But if a man wants to go
to the eighth story of a building, he should not be condemned
because he does not mount to the ninth; if he wishes a light lunch,
he should not be found fault with for not ordering a seven-course
dinner. And yet we continually hear persons accused of
&ldquo;superficiality&rdquo; who purposely and knowingly acquire
some slight degree of knowledge of a subject instead of a higher
degree. And others are condemned, we will say, for reading for
amusement when they might have read for serious information,
without inquiring whether amusement, in this instance, was not
precisely what they needed.</p>
<p>It may be, therefore, that browsing is productive <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page106" name="page106"></a>[pg 106]</span>of some
good result, and that it fails to effect some other, perhaps some
higher, result which its critics have wrongly fixed upon as the one
desirable thing in this connection.</p>
<p>When a name embodies a figure of speech, we may often learn
something by following up the figure to see how far it holds good.
What does an animal do, and what does it not do, when it
&ldquo;browses&rdquo;? In the first place it eats food&mdash;fresh,
growing food; but, secondly, it eats this food by cropping off the
tips of the herbage, not taking much at once, and again, it moves
about from place to place, eating now here and now there and then
making selection, from one motive or another, but presumably
following the dictates of its own taste or fancy. What does it not
do? First, it does not, from choice, eat anything bad. Secondly, it
does not necessarily consume all of its food in this way. If it
finds a particularly choice spot, it may confine its feeding to
that spot; or, if its owner sees fit, he may remove it to the
stable, where it may stand all day and eat what he chooses to give
it. The benefits of browsing are, first, the nourishment actually
derived from the food taken, coupled with the fact that it is taken
in small quantities, and in great variety; and secondly, the
knowledge of good spots, obtained from the testing of one spot
after another, throughout the whole broad pasture.</p>
<p>Now I submit that our figure of speech holds good in all these
particulars. The literary &ldquo;browser&rdquo; partakes of his
mental food from books and is thereby nourished and stimulated; he
takes it here and there in brief quantities, moving from section to
section and from shelf to shelf, selecting choice morsels of
literature as fancy may dictate. He does not, if he is a healthy
reader, absorb voluntarily anything <span class="pagenum"><a id=
"page107" name="page107"></a>[pg 107]</span>that will hurt him, and
this method of literary absorption does not preclude other methods
of mental nourishment. He may like a book so much that he proceeds
to devour it whole, or his superiors in knowledge may remove him to
a place where necessary mental food is administered more or less
forcibly. And having gone so far with our comparison, we shall make
no mistake if we go a little further and say that the benefits of
browsing to the reader are twofold, as they are to the material
feeder&mdash;the absorption of actual nutriment in his own wilful,
wayward manner&mdash;a little at a time and in great variety; and
the knowledge of good reading obtained from such a wide testing of
the field.</p>
<p>Are not these real benefits, and are they not desirable? I fear
that our original surmise was correct and that browsing is
condemned not for what it does, but because it fails to do
something that it could not be expected to do. Of course, if one
were to browse continuously he would be unable to feed in any other
way. Attendance upon school or the continuous reading of any book
whatever would be obviously impossible. To avoid misunderstanding,
therefore, we will agree at this point that whatever may be said
here in commendation of browsing is on condition that it be
occasional and not excessive and that the normal amount of
continuous reading and study proceed together with it.</p>
<p>Having settled, therefore, that browsing is a good thing when
one does not occupy ones&rsquo; whole time with it, let us examine
its advantages a little more in detail.</p>
<p>First: about the mental nourishment that is absorbed in
browsing; the specific information, the appreciation of what is
good, the intellectual stimulation&mdash;not that which comes from
reading suggested <span class="pagenum"><a id="page108" name=
"page108"></a>[pg 108]</span>or guided by browsing, but from the
actual process itself. I have heard it strenuously denied that any
such absorption occurs; the bits taken are too small, the motion of
the browser is too rapid, the whole process is too desultory. Let
us see. In the first place a knowledge of authors and titles and of
the general character of their works is by no means to be despised.
I heard the other day of a presumably educated woman who betrayed
in a conversation her ignorance of Omar Khayyam&mdash;not lack of
acquaintance with his works, but lack of knowledge that such a
person had ever existed. If at some period in her life she had held
in her hand a copy of &ldquo;The Rubaiyat,&rdquo; and had glanced
at its back, without even opening it, how much embarrassment she
might have been spared! And if, in addition, she had glanced within
for just ten seconds and had discovered that he wrote poetry in
stanzas of four lines each, she would have known as much about Omar
as do many of those who would contemptuously scoff at her
ignorance. With so brief effort may we acquire literary knowledge
sufficient to avoid embarrassment in ordinary conversation.
Browsing in a good library, if the browser has a memory, will soon
equip him with a wide range of knowledge of this kind. Nor is such
knowledge to be sneered at as superficial. It is all that we know,
or need to know, about scores of authors. One may never study
higher mathematics, but it may be good for him to know that
Lagrange was a French author who wrote on analytical mechanics,
that Euclid was a Greek geometer, and that Hamilton invented
quaternions. All this and vastly more may be impressed on the mind
by an hour in the mathematical alcove of a library of moderate
size. And it will do no harm to a boy to know that Benvenuto
Cellini wrote his autobiography, even if <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page109" name="page109"></a>[pg 109]</span>the
inevitable perusal of the book is delayed for several years, or
that Felicia Hemans, James Thomson, and Robert Herrick wrote
poetry, independently of familiarity with their works, or that
&ldquo;Lamia&rdquo; is not something to eat or &ldquo;As you like
it&rdquo; a popular novel. Information of this kind is almost
impossible to acquire from lists or from oral statement, whereas a
moment&rsquo;s handling of a book in the concrete may fix it in the
mind for good and all. So far, we have not supposed that even a
word of the contents has been read. What, now, if a sentence, a
stanza, a paragraph, a page, passes into the brain through the eye?
Those who measure literary effect by the thousand words or by the
hour are making a great mistake. The lightning flash is over in a
fraction of a second, but in that time it may reveal a scene of
beauty, may give the traveller warning of the fatal precipice, or
may shatter the farmer&rsquo;s home into kindling wood.
Intellectual lightning may strike the &ldquo;browser&rdquo; as he
stands there book in hand before the shelf. A word, a phrase, may
sear into his brain&mdash;may turn the current of his whole life.
And even if no such epoch-making words meet his eye, in how brief a
time may he read, digest, appreciate, some of the gems of
literature! Leigh Hunt&rsquo;s &ldquo;Jennie kissed me&rdquo; would
probably take about thirty seconds; on a second reading he would
have it by heart&mdash;the joy of a life-time. How many meaty
epigrams would take as long? The whole of Gray&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Elegy&rdquo; is hardly beyond the browser&rsquo;s limit.</p>
<p>In an editorial on the Harvard Classics in the &ldquo;Chicago
evening post&rdquo;, (April 22), we read, &ldquo;the cultural
tabloid has very little virtue;&hellip; to gain everything that a
book has to give one must be submerged in it, saturated and
absorbed&rdquo;. This is very much like saying, &ldquo;there is
very little nourishment <span class="pagenum"><a id="page110" name=
"page110"></a>[pg 110]</span>in a sandwich; to get the full effect
of a luncheon you must eat everything on the table&rdquo;. It is a
truism to say that you can not get everything in a book without
reading all of it; but it by no means follows that the virtue of
less than the whole is negligible.</p>
<p>So much for the direct effect of what one may thus take in, bit
by bit. The indirect effect is even more important. For by sampling
a whole literature, as he does, he not only gets a bird&rsquo;s-eye
view of it, but he finds out what lie likes and what he dislikes;
he begins to form his taste. Are you afraid that he will form it
wrong? I am not. We are assuming that the library where he browses
is a good one; here is no chance of evil, only a choice between
different kinds of good. And even if the evil be there, it is
astonishing how the healthy mind will let it slip and fasten
eagerly on the good. Would you prefer a taste fixed by someone who
tells the browser what he ought to like? Then that is not the
reader&rsquo;s own taste at all, but that of his informant. We have
too much of this sort of thing&mdash;too many readers without an
atom of taste of their own who will say, for instance, that they
adore George Meredith, because some one has told them that all
intellectual persons do so. The man who frankly loves George Ade
and can yet see nothing in Shakespeare may one day discover
Shakespeare. The man who reads Shakespeare merely because he thinks
he ought to is hopeless.</p>
<p>But what a triumph, to stand spell-bound by the art of a writer
whose name you never heard, and then discover that he is one of the
great ones of the world! Nought is comparable to it except perhaps
to pick out all by yourself in the exhibition the one picture that
the experts have chosen for the museum <span class="pagenum"><a id=
"page111" name="page111"></a>[pg 111]</span>or to be able to say
you liked olives the first time you tasted them.</p>
<p>Who are your favorites? Did some one guide you to them or did
you find them yourselves? I will warrant that in many cases you
discovered them and that this is why you love them. I discovered
DeQuincey&rsquo;s romances, Praed&rsquo;s poetry, B&eacute;ranger
in French, Heine in German, &ldquo;The Arabian nights&rdquo;,
Moli&egrave;re, Irving&rsquo;s &ldquo;Alhambra,&rdquo; hundreds of
others probably. I am sure that I love them all far more than if
some one had told me they were good books. If I had been obliged to
read them in school and pass an examination on them, I should have
hated them. The teacher who can write an examination paper on
Gray&rsquo;s &ldquo;Elegy&rdquo;, would, I firmly believe, cut up
his grandmother alive before the physiology class.</p>
<p>And next to the author or the book that you have discovered
yourself comes the one that the discoverer himself&mdash;your boy
or girl friend&mdash;tells you about. <em>He</em> knows a good
thing&mdash;<em>she</em> knows it! No school nonsense about that;
no adult misunderstanding. I found out Poe that way, and
Thackeray&rsquo;s &ldquo;Major Gahagan&rdquo;, and many others.</p>
<p>To go back to our old illustration and consider for a moment not
the book but the mind, the personality whose ideas it records, such
association with books represents association with one&rsquo;s
fellowmen in society&mdash;at a reception, in school or college, at
a club. Some we pass by with a nod, with some we exchange a word;
sometimes there is a warm handgrasp; sometimes a long conversation.
No matter what the mental contact may be, it has its
effects&mdash;we are continually gaining knowledge, making new
friends, receiving fresh inspiration. The complexion of this kind
of daily association determines the <span class="pagenum"><a id=
"page112" name="page112"></a>[pg 112]</span>cast of one&rsquo;s
mind, the thoroughness of his taste, the usefulness or uselessness
of what he does. A man is known by the company he keeps, because
that company forms him; he gets from it what becomes brain of his
brain and soul of his soul.</p>
<p>And no less is he formed by his mental associations with the
good and the great of all ages whom he meets in books and who talk
to him there. More rather than less; for into a book the writer
puts generally what is best in him, laying aside the pettiness, the
triviality, the downright wickedness that may have characterized
him in the flesh.</p>
<p>I have often heard the comment from one who had met face to face
a writer whose work he loved&mdash;&ldquo;Oh! he disappointed me
so!&rdquo; How disappointed might we be with Thackeray, with
Dickens, even with Shakespeare, could we meet them in the flesh!
Now they can not disappoint us, for we know only what they have
left on record&mdash;the best, the most enduring part, purified
from what is gross and earthly.</p>
<p>In and among such company as this it is your privilege to live
and move, almost without money and without price. Thank God for
books; let them be your friends and companions through
life&mdash;for information, for recreation, but above all for
inspiration.</p>

<p>A theory involving some sort of a discrete or discontinuous
structure of energy has been put forward by Prof. Max Planck of the
University of Berlin. The various aspects of this theory are
discussed and elaborated by the late M. Henri Poincar&eacute; in a
paper entitled &ldquo;L&rsquo;Hypoth&egrave;se des Quanta,&rdquo;
published in the <em>Revue Scientifique</em> (Paris, Feb. 21,
1912).</p>
<p>A paper in which a discontinuous or &ldquo;atomic&rdquo;
structure of energy was suggested was prepared by the present
writer fifteen years ago but remains unpublished for reasons that
will appear later. Although he has no desire to put in a claim of
priority and is well aware that failure to publish would put any
such claim out of court, it seems to him that in connection with
present radical developments in physical theory the paper, together
with some correspondence relating thereto, has historical interest.
Planck&rsquo;s theory was suggested by thermodynamical
considerations. In the paper now to be quoted the matter was
approached from the standpoint of a criterion for determining the
identity of two portions of matter or of energy. The paper is as
follows:</p>
<h3><em>Some Consideration on the Identity of Definite Portions of
Energy</em></h3>
<p>It has been remarked recently that physicists are now divided
into two opposing schools according to the way in which they view
the subject of energy, some regarding it as a mere mathematical
abstraction and others looking upon it as a physical entity,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page114" name="page114"></a>[pg
114]</span>filling space and continuously migrating by definite
paths from one place to another. It may be added that there are
numerous factions within these two parties; for instance, not all
of those who consider energy to be something more than a mere
mathematical expression would maintain that a given quantity of it
retains its identity just as a given quantity of matter does. In
fact a close analysis would possibly show that opinions are graded
very closely and continuously from a view hardly differing from
that of Lagrange, who clearly saw and freely used the mathematical
considerations involving energy before the word had been invented
or its physical meaning developed, up to that stated recently in
its extreme form by Professor Ostwald, who would replace what he
terms a mechanical theory of the universe by an
&ldquo;energetical&rdquo; theory, and would dwell exclusively on
energy as opposed to its vehicles.</p>
<p>Differences of opinion of this sort very frequently reduce to
differences of definition, and in this case the meaning of the word
&ldquo;identity&rdquo; or some similar word or phrase has
undoubtedly much to do with the view that is taken of the matter.
It may be interesting, for instance, to look for a moment at our
ideas of the identity of matter and the extent to which they are
influenced by the accepted theory of its constitution.</p>
<p>Very few persons would hesitate to admit that the matter that
now constitutes the universe is identical in amount with that which
constituted it one million years ago, and that any given portion of
that matter is identical with an equal amount of matter that then
existed, although the situations of the parts of that portion might
be and probably were widely different in the two classes. To assert
this is of course a very different thing from asserting that
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page115" name="page115"></a>[pg
115]</span>the identity of the two portions or any parts thereof
could have been practically shown by following them during all
their changes of location or state. That cannot be done even in the
case of some simple changes that are effected in a fraction of a
second. For instance, if water from the pail A be mixed with water
from the pail B there is no possible way of telling which pail any
given portion of the mixture came from or in what proportions, yet
it is certain that such portion is identical with a portion of
equal mass that recently occupied part of one or both pails.</p>
<p>How far our certainty as to this is influenced by our ideas
regarding the ultimate constitution of the water is worthy of
investigation. All who accept the molecular theory, for instance,
will regard our inability to trace the elements of a mixture as due
to purely physical limitations. A set of Maxwell&rsquo;s
&ldquo;demons&rdquo; if bidden to watch the molecules of the water
in pail A, one demon being assigned to each molecule, would be able
to tell us at any time the precise proportions of any given part of
the mixture. But if we should not accept the molecular theory and
believe for instance, that water is a continuum, absolutely
homogeneous, no matter how small portions of it be selected, then
our demons would be as powerless as we ourselves now are to trace
the constituents in the mixture.</p>
<p>We are now in a position to ask the question: Is the matter in a
mixture of two continua identical with that of its constituents?
The identity certainly seems of a different kind or degree from
that which obtains in the first case, for there is no part, however
small, that was derived from one pail alone. The mixture is
something more than a mere juxtaposition of elements each of which
has retained its <span class="pagenum"><a id="page116" name=
"page116"></a>[pg 116]</span>identity; it is now of suck nature
that no part of it is identical with any part of A alone or of B
alone, nor of A+B, where the sign + denotes simple juxtaposition.
It is identical, to be sure, with a perfect mixture of certain
parts of A and B, but this is simply saying that it is identical
with what it is now, that is, with itself, not with something that
went before.</p>
<p>Probably no one now believes that water or any other kind of
matter is a continuum, but the bearing of what has been said may be
seen when we remember that this is precisely the present stage of
our belief regarding energy.</p>
<p>No one, so far as I know, has ventured to suggest what may be
termed a molecular theory of energy, a somewhat remarkable fact
when we consider the control now exercised over all thought in
physics by molecular theories of matter. While we now believe, for
instance, that a material body, say a crystal, can by no
possibility increase continuously in mass, but must do so step by
step, the minimum mass of matter that can be added being the
molecule, we believe on the contrary that the energy possessed by
the same body can and may increase with absolutely perfect
continuity, being hampered by no such restriction.</p>
<p>It is not the purpose of this paper to discuss whether we have
grounds for belief that there is such a thing as a minimum
quantity, or atom, of energy, that does not separate into smaller
parts, no matter what changes it undergoes. Suffice it to say that
there appears to be no <em>a priori</em> absurdity in such an idea.
At first sight both matter and energy appear non-molecular in
structure. But we have been forced to look upon the gradual growth
of a crystal as a step-by-step process, and we may some
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page117" name="page117"></a>[pg
117]</span>day, by equally cogent considerations, be forced to
regard the gradual increase of energy of an accelerating body as
also a step-by-step process, although the discontinuity is as
invisible to the eye in the latter case as in the former.</p>
<p>Without following this out any farther, however, the point may
be here emphasized that it is hardly possible for one who, like the
majority of physicists, regards matter as molecular and energy as a
continuum, to hold the same ideas regarding the identity of the
two. Efforts to show that definite portions of energy, like
definite portions of matter, retain their identity have hitherto
been made chiefly on the lines of a demonstration that energy
travels by definite and continuous paths in space just as matter
does. This is very well, but it would appear to be necessary to
supplement it with evidence to show that the lines representing
these paths do not form at their intersections continuous blurs
that not only forbid any practical attempt at identification on
emergence, but make it doubtful whether we can in any true sense
call the issuing path identical with the entering one. Otherwise
the identity of energy can be admitted to be only that kind of
identity that could be preserved by matter if its molecular
structure did not exist. One who can admit that this sort of
identity is the same sort that can be preserved by molecular matter
may be able to hold the identity of energy in the present state of
the evidence, but the present attitude of physicists would seem to
show that, whether they realize the connection of the two subjects
or not, they cannot take this view. In other words, modern views of
the identity of matter seem closely connected with modern views of
its structure, and the same connection will doubtless hold good for
energy.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page118" name="page118"></a>[pg
118]</span>Regarding the probable success of an attempt to prove
that energy has a &ldquo;structure&rdquo; analogous to the
molecular structure of matter, any prediction would doubtless be
rash just now. The writer has been unable, up to the present time,
to disprove the proposition, but the subject is one of
corresponding importance to that of the whole molecular theory of
matter and should not be entered upon lightly.</p>
<hr />
<p>The writer freely acknowledges at present that the illustrations
in the foregoing are badly chosen and some of the statements are
too strong, but it still represents essentially his ideas on the
subject. No reputable scientific journal would undertake to publish
it. The paper was then sent to Prof. J. Willard Gibbs of Yale, and
elicited the following letter from him:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="font-variant:small-caps">&ldquo;New Haven, June 2,
1897.</p>
<p style="font-variant:small-caps">&ldquo;My Dear Mr. Bostwick:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I regret that I have allowed your letter to lie so long
unanswered. It was in fact not very easy to answer, and when one
lays a letter aside to answer, the weeks slip away very fast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not think that you state the matter quite right in
regard to the mixture of fluids if they were continuous. The mixing
of water as I regard it would be like this, if it were continuous
and not molecular. Suppose you should take strips of white and red
glass and heat them until soft and twist them together. Keep on
drawing them out and doubling them up and twisting them together.
It would soon require a microscope to distinguish the red and white
glass, which would be drawn out into thinner and thinner filaments
if the matter were continuous. But it would be always only a matter
of optical power to distinguish perfectly the portion of red and
white glass. The stirring up of water from two pails would not
really mix them but only entangle filaments from the pails.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To come to the case of energy. All our ideas concerning
energy seem to require that it is capable of gradual increase. Thus
the energy due to velocity can increase continuously if velocity
can. Since the energy is as the square of the velocity, if the
velocity can only increase discontinuously by equal increments, the
energy of the body will increase by unequal increments in such a
way as to make the exchange of energy between bodies a very awkward
matter to adjust.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But apart from the question of the increase of energy by
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page119" name="page119"></a>[pg
119]</span>discontinuous increments, the question of relative and
absolute motion makes it very hard to give a particular position to
energy, since the &lsquo;energy&rsquo; we speak of in any case is
not one quantity but may be interpreted in a great many ways. Take
the important case of two equal elastic balls. One, moving, strikes
the other at rest, we say, and gives it nearly all its energy. But
we have no right to call one ball at rest and we can not say (as
anything absolute) which of the balls has lost and which has gained
energy. If there is such a thing as absolute energy of motion it is
something entirely unknowable to us. Take the solar system,
supposed isolated. We may take as our origin of coordinates the
center of gravity of the system. Or we may take an origin with
respect to which the center of gravity of the solar system has any
(constant) velocity. The kinetic energy of the earth, for example,
may have any value whatever, and the principle of the conservation
of energy will hold in any case for the whole solar system. But the
shifting of energy from one planet to another will take place
entirely differently when we estimate the energies with reference
to different origins.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It does not seem to me that your ideas fit in with what
we know about nature. If you ask my advice, I should not advise you
to try to publish them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At best you would be entering into a discussion (perhaps
not in bad company) in which words would play a greater part than
precise ideas.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is the way I feel about it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I remain,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yours faithfully,</p>
<p style="font-variant:small-caps">&ldquo;J.W. Gibbs.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Professor Gibbs&rsquo;s criticism of the illustration of
water-mixture is evidently just. Another might well have been used
where the things mixed are not material&mdash;for instance, the
value of money deposited in a bank. If A and B each deposits $100
to C&rsquo;s credit and C then draws $10, there is evidently no way
of determining what part of it came from A and what from B. The
structure of &ldquo;value&rdquo;, in other words, is perfectly
continuous. Professor Gibbs&rsquo;s objections to an
&ldquo;atomic&rdquo; theory of the structure of energy are most
interesting. The difficulties that it involves are not overstated.
In 1897 they made it unnecessary, but since that time
considerations have been brought forward, and generally recognized,
which may make it necessary to brave those difficulties.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page120" name="page120"></a>[pg
120]</span>Planck&rsquo;s theory was suggested by the apparent
necessity of modifying the generally accepted theory of statistical
equilibrium involving the so called &ldquo;law of
equipartition,&rdquo; enunciated first for gases and extended to
liquids and solids.</p>
<p>In the first place the kinetic theory fixes the number of
degrees of freedom of each gaseous molecule, which would be three
for argon, for instance, and five for oxygen. But what prevents
either from having the six degrees to which ordinary mechanical
theory entitles it? Furthermore, the oxygen spectrum has more than
five lines, and the molecule must therefore vibrate in more than
five modes. &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; asks Poincar&eacute;, &ldquo;do
certain degrees of freedom appear to play no part here; why are
they, so to speak, &lsquo;ankylosed&rsquo;?&rdquo; Again, suppose a
system in statistical equilibrium, each part gaining on an average,
in a short time, exactly as much as it loses. If the system
consists of molecules and ether, as the former have a finite number
of degrees of freedom and the latter an infinite number, the
unmodified law of equipartition would require that the ether should
finally appropriate all energy, leaving none of it to the matter.
To escape this conclusion we have Rayleigh&rsquo;s law that the
radiated energy, for a given wave length, is proportional to the
absolute temperature, and for a given temperature is in inverse
ratio to the fourth power of the wave-length. This is found by
Planck to be experimentally unverifiable, the radiation being less
for small wave-lengths and low temperatures, than the law
requires.</p>
<p>Still again, the specific heats of solids, instead of being
sensibly constant at all temperatures, are found to diminish
rapidly in the low temperatures now available in liquid air or
hydrogen and apparently tend to disappear at absolute zero.
&ldquo;All takes place,&rdquo; says Poincar&eacute;, &ldquo;as if
these molecules lost <span class="pagenum"><a id="page121" name=
"page121"></a>[pg 121]</span>some of their degrees of freedom in
cooling&mdash;as if some of their articulations froze at the
limit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Planck attempts to explain these facts by introducing the idea
of what he calls &ldquo;quanta&rdquo; of energy. To quote from
Poincar&eacute;&rsquo;s paper:</p>
<p>&ldquo;How should we picture a radiating body? We know that a
Hertz resonator sends into the ether Hertzian waves that are
identical with luminous waves; an incandescent body must then be
regarded as containing a very great number of tiny resonators. When
the body is heated, these resonators acquire energy, start
vibrating and consequently radiate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Planck&rsquo;s hypothesis consists in the supposition
that each of these resonators can acquire or lose energy only by
abrupt jumps, in such a way that the store of energy that it
possesses must always be a multiple of a constant quantity, which
he calls a &lsquo;quantum&rsquo;&mdash;must be composed of a whole
number of quanta. This indivisible unit, this quantum, is not the
same for all resonators; it is in inverse ratio to the wave-length,
so that resonators of short period can take in energy only in large
pieces, while those of long period can absorb or give it out by
small bits. What is the result? Great effort is necessary to
agitate a short-period resonator, since this requires at least a
quantity of energy equal to its quantum, which is great. The
chances are, then, that these resonators will keep quiet,
especially if the temperature is low, and it is for this reason
that there is relatively little short-wave radiation in
&lsquo;black radiation&rsquo;&hellip; The diminution of
specific-heats is explained similarly: When the temperature falls,
a large number of vibrators fall below their quantum and cease to
vibrate, so that the total energy diminishes faster than the old
theories require.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here we have the germs of an atomic theory of energy. As
Poincar&eacute; now points out, the trouble is <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page122" name="page122"></a>[pg 122]</span>that
the quanta are not constant. In his study of the matter he notes
that the work of Prof. Wilhelm Wien, of W&uuml;rzburg, leads by
theory to precisely the conclusion announced by Planck that if we
are to hold to the accepted ideas of statistical equilibrium the
energy can vary only by quanta inversely proportional to
wave-length. The mechanical property of the resonators imagined by
Planck is therefore precisely that which Wien&rsquo;s theory
requires. If we are to suppose atoms of energy, therefore, they
must be variable atoms. There are other objections which need not
be touched upon here, the whole theory being in a very early stage.
To quote Poincar&eacute; again:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The new conception is seductive from a certain
standpoint: for some time the tendency has been toward atomism.
Matter appears to us as formed of indivisible atoms; electricity is
no longer continuous, not infinitely divisible. It resolves itself
into equally-charged electrons; we have also now the magneton, or
atom of magnetism. From this point of view the quanta appear as
<em>atoms</em> of <em>energy</em>. Unfortunately the comparison may
not be pushed to the limit; a hydrogen atom is really
invariable&hellip;. The electrons preserve their individuality amid
the most diverse vicissitudes, is it the same with the atoms of
energy? We have, for instance, three quanta of energy in a
resonator whose wave-length is 3; this passes to a second resonator
whose wave-length is 5; it now represents not 3 but 5 quanta, since
the quantum of the new resonator is smaller and in the
transformation the number of atoms and the size of each has
changed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If, however, we replace the atom of energy by an &ldquo;atom of
action,&rdquo; these atoms may be considered equal and invariable.
The whole study of thermodynamic equilibrium has been reduced by
the French <span class="pagenum"><a id="page123" name=
"page123"></a>[pg 123]</span> mathematical school to a question of
probability. &ldquo;The probability of a continuous variable is
obtained by considering elementary independent domains of equal
probability&hellip;. In the classic dynamics we use, to find these
elementary domains, the theorem that two physical states of which
one is the necessary effect of the other are equally probable. In a
physical system if we represent by <em>q</em> one of the
generalized coordinates and by <em>p</em> the corresponding
momentum, according to Liouville&rsquo;s theorem the domain
<em>&int;&int;dpdq</em>, considered at given instant, is invariable
with respect to the time if <em>p</em> and <em>q</em> vary
according to Hamilton&rsquo;s equations. On the other hand
<em>p</em> and <em>q</em> may, at a given instant take all possible
values, independent of each other. Whence it follows that the
elementary domain is infinitely small, of the magnitude
<em>dpdq</em>&hellip;. The new hypothesis has for its object to
restrict the variability of <em>p</em> and <em>q</em> so that these
variables will only change by jumps&hellip;. Thus the number of
elementary domains of probability is reduced and the extent of each
is augmented. The hypothesis of quanta of action consists in
supposing that these domains are all equal and no longer infinitely
small but finite and that for each <em>&int;&int;dpdq</em> equals
<em>h</em>, <em>h</em> being a constant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Put a little less mathematically, this simply means that as
energy equals action multiplied by frequency, the fact that the
quantum of energy is proportional to the frequency (or inversely to
the wave-length as stated above) is due simply to the fact that the
quantum of action is constant&mdash;a real atom. The general effect
on our physical conceptions, however, is the same: we have a purely
discontinuous universe&mdash;discontinuous not only in matter but
in energy and the flow of time. M. Poincar&eacute; thus puts it:
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page124" name="page124"></a>[pg
124]</span>&rdquo;A physical system is susceptible only of a finite
number of distinct states; it leaps from one of these to the next
without passing through any continuous series of intermediate
states.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He notes later:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The universe, then, leaps suddenly from one state to
another; but in the interval it must remain immovable, and the
divers instants during which it keeps in the same state can no
longer be discriminated from one another; we thus reach a
conception of the discontinuous variation of time&mdash;the atom of
<em>time</em>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I quote in conclusion, Poincar&eacute;&rsquo;s final
remarks:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The present state of the question is thus as follows: the
old theories, which hitherto seemed to account for all the known
phenomena, have met with an unexpected obstacle. Seemingly a
modification becomes necessary. A hypothesis has presented itself
to M. Planck&rsquo;s mind, but so strange a one that one is tempted
to seek every means of escaping it; these means, however, have been
sought vainly. The new theory, however, raises a host of
difficulties, many of which are real and not simply illusions due
to the indolence of our minds, unwilling to change their modes of
thought&hellip;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is discontinuity to reign through out the physical
universe, and is its triumph definitive? Or rather shall we find
that it is but apparent and hides a series of continuous
processes?&hellip; To try to give an opinion just now on these
questions would only be to waste ink.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It only remains to call attention again to the fact that this
conception of the discontinuity of energy, the acceptance of which
Poincar&eacute; says would be &ldquo;the most profound revolution
that natural philosophy has undergone since Newton&rdquo; was
suggested by <span class="pagenum"><a id="page125" name=
"page125"></a>[pg 125]</span>the present writer fifteen years ago.
Its reception and serious consideration by one of the first
mathematical physicists of the world seems a sufficient
justification of its suggestion then as a legitimate scientific

<h2><a name="Essay12" id="Essay12">The Advertisement of
Ideas</a></h2>
<p class="returnTOC"><a href="#Contents">Return to Table of
Contents</a></p>
<p>Writing is a device for the storage of ideas&mdash;the only
device for this purpose prior to the invention of the phonograph,
and not now likely to be generally superseded. A book consists of
stored ideas; sometimes it is like a box, from which the contents
must be lifted slowly and with more or less toil; sometimes like a
storage battery where one only has to make the right kind of
contact to get a discharge. At any rate, if we want people to use
books or to use them more, or to use them better, or to use a
different kind from that which they now use, we must lose sight for
a moment of the material part of the book, which is only the box or
the lead and acid of the storage battery, and fix our attention on
the stored ideas, which are what everybody wants&mdash;everybody,
that is, except those who collect books as curiosities. The subject
of this lecture is thus only library advertising, about which we
have heard a good deal of late, but we shall try to confine its
applications to this inner or ideal substance which it is our
special business as librarians to purvey. And first, in considering
the matter, it may be worth while to say a word about advertising
in general. Practically an advertisement is an announcement by
somebody who has something to distribute. Announcements of this
kind may be classified, it seems to me, as economic, uneconomic and
illegitimate.</p>
<p>The most elementary form is that of the person who tells you
where you can get something that you want&mdash;a simple statement
that someone is a barber or an inn-keeper, or gives music lessons,
or has shoes <span class="pagenum"><a id="page128" name=
"page128"></a>[pg 128]</span>for sale. This may be accompanied by
an effort to show that the goods offered are of specially good
quality or have some feature that makes them particularly
desirable, either to consumers in general or to those of a certain
class. This is all surely economic, so long as nothing but the
truth is told. Next we have an effort not only to supply existing
wants and to direct them into some particular channel, but to
create a new field, to make people realize a lack previously not
felt; in other words to make people want something that they need.
This may be done simply by exhibiting or describing the article or
it may require long and skillful presentation of the matter. All
this is still economic. But it requires only a step to carry us
across the line. Next the enthusiastic advertiser strives to make
someone want that which he does not need. As may be seen, the line
here is difficult to determine, but this sort of advertising is
surely not economic. So long as the thing not needed is not really
injurious, however, the advertising cannot be called illegitimate.
It is simply uneconomic. The world would be better off without it,
but we may look for its abolition only to the increase of good
judgment and intelligence among consumers. When an attempt however,
is made to cause a man to want something that is really injurious,
then the act becomes illegitimate and should be prevented. Another
class of illegitimate advertising is that which would be perfectly
allowable if it were truthful and becomes objectionable only
because its representations are false. It may be ostensibly of any
of the types noted above.</p>
<p>As we have already noted, the material objects distributed by
the librarian are valued not for their physical characteristics but
for a different reason altogether, the fact that they contain
stored ideas. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page129" name=
"page129"></a>[pg 129]</span>Ideas which, according to some, are
merely the relative positions of material particles in the brain,
and which are indisputably accompanied and conditioned by such
positions, here subsist in the form of peculiar and visible
arrangements of particles of printer&rsquo;s ink upon paper, which
are capable under certain conditions of generating in the human
brain ideas precisely similar to those that gave them birth. And
although the book cannot think for itself, but must merely preserve
the idea intrusted to it, without change, it is vastly superior in
stability to the brain that gave it birth, so that thousands of
years after that brain has mouldered into dust it is capable of
reproducing the original ideas in a second brain where they may
germinate and bear fruit. How familiar all this is, and yet how
perennially wonderful! The miracle of it is sufficient excuse for
this digression.</p>
<p>Now books, beside this modern form of distribution by loan, are
widely distributed commercially both by loan and by sale, and
especially in the latter form advertisement is now very extensively
used in connection with the distribution. In fact we have all the
different types specified above&mdash;economic, uneconomic and
illegitimate, both through misrepresentation and the harmful
character of the subject matter. The reason for all illegitimate
forms of advertising is of course not a desire to misrepresent or
to do harm per se, but to make money, the profit to the distributor
being proportioned to the amount of distribution done and not at
all dependent on its economic value. Distribution by public
officers is of course not open to this objection, nor are the
distributors subject to temptation, since their compensation does
not depend on the amount of distribution. If they are capable and
interested, furthermore, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page130"
name="page130"></a>[pg 130]</span>they are particularly desirous to
increase the economic value of the work that they are doing. Since
this is so and since the danger of uneconomic or harmful forms of
advertising is thus reduced to a minimum, there would seem to be
special reason why the economic forms should be employed very
freely. But the fact is that they have been used sparingly, and by
some librarians shunned altogether.</p>
<p>Let us see what library advertising of the economic types may
mean. In the first place it means telling those who want books
where they may get them. This simple task is rarely performed
completely or satisfactorily. It is astonishing how many
inhabitants of a large town do not even know where the public
library is. Everyone realizes this who has ever tried to find a
public library in a strange place. I once asked repeatedly of
passers-by in a crowded city street a block distant from a library
(in this case not architecturally conspicuous) before finding one
who knew its whereabouts; in another city I inquired in vain of a
conductor who passed the building every few hours in his car. In
the latter case the library was a beautiful structure calculated to
move the curiosity of a less stolid citizen. In New York inquiry
would probably cause you to reach the nearest branch library,
anything more remote than that being beyond the local intelligence.
Sometimes I think we had better drop all our far-reaching plans for
civic betterment and devote our time for a few years to causing
citizens, lettered and unlettered alike to memorize some such
simple formula as this: &ldquo;There is a Public Library. It is on
Blank street. We may borrow books there, free.&rdquo;</p>
<p>You will notice that I have inserted in this formula one item of
information that pertains to use, not location. For of those who
know of the existence <span class="pagenum"><a id="page131" name=
"page131"></a>[pg 131]</span>and location of the Public Library
there are many whose ideas of its contents and their uses, and of
the conditions and value of such uses, are limited and crude. The
advertising that succeeds in bettering this state of things is
surely doing an economic service. All these things the
self-respecting citizen should know. But beyond and above all this
there is the final economic service of advertising&mdash;the
causing a man to want that which he needs but does not yet desire.
Every man, woman and child in every town and village needs books in
some shape, degree, form or substance. And yet the proportion of
those who desire them is yet outrageously small, though
encouragingly on the increase. Here no memorizing of a formula,
even could we compass it, could suffice. This kind of advertising
means the realization of something lacking in a life. Is the
awakening of such a realization too much for us? Are we to stand by
and see our neighbors all about us awakening to the undoubted fact
that they need telephones in their houses, and electric runabouts,
and mechanical fans in hot weather, and pianolas, and new kinds of
breakfast food, while we despair of awakening them to their needs
of books&mdash;quite as undoubted? Are we to admit that personal
gain, which was the victorious motive that spurred on the
commercial advertisers in these and countless other instances, is
to be counted more mighty than the desire to do a service to our
fellowmen and to fulfill the duties of our positions&mdash;which
should spur us on?</p>
<p>I am not foolish enough to suppose that by placarding the fences
with the words &ldquo;Books! Books!&rdquo; as the patent medicine
man does with &ldquo;Curoline! Curoline!&rdquo; we shall make any
progress. The patent medicine man is right; he wants to excite
curiosity <span class="pagenum"><a id="page132" name=
"page132"></a>[pg 132]</span>and familiarize the public with the
name of his nostrum. They all know what a book is&mdash;and alas
the name is not even unknown and mysterious&mdash;would that it
were! It calls up in many minds associations which, if we are to be
successful we must combat, overthrow, and replace by others. To
many&mdash;sad it is to say it&mdash;a book is an abhorrent thing;
to more still, it is a thing of absolute indifference. To some a
book is merely a collection of things, having no ascertainable
relationships, that one is required to memorize; to others it is a
collection of statements, difficult to understand, out of which the
meaning must be extracted by hard study; to very few indeed does
the book appear to be what it really is&mdash;a message from
another mind. People will go to a seance and listen with thrills to
the silliest stuff purporting to proceed from Plato or Daniel
Webster or Abraham Lincoln, when in the Public Library, a few
blocks away are important and authentic messages from those same
persons, to which they have never given heed. Such a message
derives interest and significance from circumstances outside
itself. Very few books create their own atmosphere unaided. They
presuppose a system of abilities, opinions, prejudices, likes and
dislikes, intellectual connections and what not, that is little
less than appalling, if we try to follow it up. Dislike of books or
indifference toward them is often simply the result of a lack of
these things or of some component part of them. We must supply what
is lacking if we are to arouse a desire for books in those who do
not yet possess it. I say that such a labor is difficult enough to
interest him whose pleasure it is to essay hard tasks; it is noble
enough to attract him who loves his fellow-man; success in it is
rare enough and glorious enough to stimulate him who likes to
succeed where <span class="pagenum"><a id="page133" name=
"page133"></a>[pg 133]</span>others have failed. Advertising may be
good or bad, noble or ignoble, right or wrong, according to what is
advertised and our methods of advertising it. He who would scorn to
announce the curative powers of bottled spring-water and pink
aniline dye; he who regards it as a commonplace task to urge upon
the spendthrift public the purchase of unnecessary gloves and
neckties, may well feel a thrill of satisfaction and of
anticipation in the task of advertising ideas and of persuading the
unheeding citizen to appropriate what he has been accustomed to
view with indifference.</p>
<p>To get at the root of the matter, let us inquire why it is that
so many persons do not care for books. We may divide them, I think,
into two classes&mdash;those who do not care, or appear not to care
for ideas at all, whether stored in books or not; and those who do
care for ideas but who either do not easily get them out of storage
or do not realize that they can be and are stored in books.
Absolute carelessness of ideas is, it seems to me, rather apparent
than real. It exists only in the idiot. There are those to be sure
that care about a very limited range of ideas; but about some ideas
they always care.</p>
<p>We must, in our advertisement of ideas, bear this in
mind&mdash;the necessity of offering to each that which he
considers it worth his while to take. If I were asked what is the
most fundamentally interesting subject to all classes, I should
unhesitatingly reply &ldquo;philosophy.&rdquo; Not, perhaps, the
philosophy of the schools, but the individual philosophy that every
man and woman has, and that is precisely alike in no two of us. I
have heard a tiny boy, looking up suddenly from his play, ask
&ldquo;Why do we live?&rdquo; This and its correlative &ldquo;Why
do we die?&rdquo; Whence come we and whither do we go? What is the
universe and <span class="pagenum"><a id="page134" name=
"page134"></a>[pg 134]</span>what are our relations to
it&mdash;these questions in some form have occurred to everyone who
thinks at all. They are discussed around the stove at the corner
grocery, in the logging camp, on the ranch, in clubs and at
boarding-house tables. Sometimes they take a theological
turn&mdash;free will, the origin and purpose of evil, and so on. I
do not purpose to give here a catalogue of the things in which an
ordinary man is interested, and I have said this only to remind you
that his interest may be vivid even in connection with subjects
usually considered abstruse. This interest in ideas we may call the
library&rsquo;s raw material; anything that tends to create it, to
broaden it, to extend it to new fields and to direct it into paths
that are worth while is making it possible for the library to do
better and wider work&mdash;is helping on its campaign of
publicity. This establishes a web of connecting fibers between the
library and all human activity. The man who is getting interested
in his work, debaters at a labor union, students at school and
college, the worker for civic reform, the poetic dreamer&mdash;all
are creating a demand for ideas that makes it easier for the
library to advertise them. Those who object to some of the outside
work done by modern libraries should try to look at the whole
matter from this standpoint. The library is taking its place as a
public utility with other public utilities. Its relations with them
are becoming more evident; the ties between them are growing
stronger. As in all cases of such growth it is becoming
increasingly difficult to identify the boundaries between them, so
fast and so thoroughly do the activities of each reach over these
lines and interpenetrate those of the others. And unless there is
actual wasteful duplication of work, we need not bother about our
respective spheres. These activities are all human; <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page135" name="page135"></a>[pg 135]</span>they
are mutually interesting and valuable. A library need be afraid of
doing nothing that makes for the spread of interest in ideas, so
long as it is not neglecting its own particular work of the
collection, preservation and distribution of ideas as stored in
books, and is not duplicating other&rsquo;s work wastefully.</p>
<p>When we observe those who are already interested in ideas,
however, we find that not all are interested in them as they are
stored up in books. Some of these cannot read; their number is
small with us and growing smaller; we may safely leave the schools
to deal with them. Others can read, but they do not easily
apprehend ideas through print. Some of these must read aloud so
that they may get the sound of the words, before these really mean
anything to them. These persons need practice in reading. They get
it now largely through the newspapers, but their number is still
large. A person in this condition may be intellectually somewhat
advanced. He may be able to discuss single-tax with some acumen,
for instance. It is a mistake to suppose that because a person
understands a subject or likes a thing and is able to talk well
about it, he will enjoy and appreciate a book on that subject or
thing. It may be as difficult for him to get at the meat of it as
if it were a half-understood foreign tongue. You who know enough
French to buy a pair of gloves or sufficient German to inquire the
way to the station, may tackle a novel in the original and realize
at once the hazy degree of such a persons&rsquo; apprehension. He
may stick to it and become an easy reader, but on the other hand
your well-meant publicity efforts may place in his hands a book
that will simply discourage and ultimately repel him, sending him
to join the army of those to whom no books appeal.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page136" name="page136"></a>[pg
136]</span>Next we find those who understand how to read and to
read with ease, but to whom books&mdash;at any rate certain classes
of books&mdash;are not interesting. Now interest in a subject may
be so great that one will wade through the driest literature about
it, but such interest belongs to the few&mdash;not to the many. I
have come to the conclusion that more readers have had their
interest killed or lessened by books than have had it aroused or
stimulated. This is a proportion that it is our business as
librarians to reverse. More of this unfortunate and heart-breaking,
interest-killing work than I like to think of goes on in school.
Not necessarily; for the name of those is legion who have had their
eyes opened to the beauties of literature by good teachers. This
makes it all the more maddening when we think how many poor
teachers, or good teachers with mistaken methods, or indifferent
teachers, have succeeded in associating with books in the minds of
their pupils simply burdensome tasks&mdash;the gloom and heaviness
of life rather than its joy and lightness. Such boys and girls will
no more touch a book after leaving school than you or I would touch
a scorpion after one had stung us.</p>
<p>Perhaps it is useless to try to change this; possibly it is none
of our business, though we have already seen that there are reasons
to the contrary. But we can better matters, and we are daily
bettering them, by our work with children. If a child has once
learned to love books and to associate them powerfully with
something else than a burdensome task, then the labors of the
unskillful teachers will create no dislike of the book but only of
the teacher and his methods; while those of the good teacher will
be a thousand times more fruitful than otherwise.</p>
<p>So much for the ways in which interesting books <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page137" name="page137"></a>[pg 137]</span>are
sometimes made uninteresting. Now for the books that are
uninteresting <em>per se</em>&mdash;and how many there are! When a
man has something to distribute commercially for personal gain, the
thing that he tries above all to do is to interest his
public&mdash;to make them want what he has to sell. His success or
failure in doing this, means the success or failure of his whole
enterprise. He does not decide what kind of an entertainment his
clients ought to attend and then try to make them go to it, or what
kind of neckties they ought to wear and then try to make them wear
them. Of ten promoters, if nine proceeded on this principle and one
on the plan of offering something attractive and interesting, who
would succeed? It is one of the marvels of all time that this never
seems to have occurred to writers of books. We are almost forced to
conclude that they do not care whether their volumes are read or
not. In only one class of books, as a rule, do the writers endeavor
to interest the reader first and foremost; you all know that I
refer to fiction. What is the result? The writers of fiction are
the ones read by the public. More fiction is read, as you very well
know, than all the other classes of literature put together. The
library that is able to show a fiction percentage of 60, points to
it with pride, while there are plenty with percentages between 70
and 80. Now this is all to the credit of the fiction writers. I
refuse to believe that their readers are any more fundamentally
interested in the subjects of which they treat than in others. They
simply follow the line of least resistance. They want something
interesting to read and they know from experience where to go for
it. Of course this brings on abuses. Writers use illegitimate
methods to arouse interest&mdash;appeals perhaps, to unworthy
instincts. We need not discuss that here, but simply focus our
attention on the fact that <span class="pagenum"><a id="page138"
name="page138"></a>[pg 138]</span>writers of fiction always try to
be interesting because they must; while writers of history, travel,
biography and philosophy do not usually try, because they think it
unnecessary. This is simply a survival. It used to be true that
readers of these subjects read them because of their great
antecedent interest in them&mdash;an interest so great that
interesting methods of presentation became unnecessary. No one
cared about the masses, still less about what they might or might
not read. Things are changed now; we are trying to advertise stored
ideas to persons unfamiliar with them and we are suddenly awakening
to the fact that our stock is not all that it should be. We need
history, science and travel fascinatingly presented&mdash;at least
as interestingly as the fiction-writer presents his subjects. This
is by no means impossible, because it has been done, in a few
instances. We are by no means in the position of the Irishman who
didn&rsquo;t know whether or not he could play the piano, because
he had never tried. Some of our authors have tried&mdash;and
succeeded. No one after William James can say that philosophy
cannot be made interesting to the ordinary reader. Tyndall showed
us long ago that physics could interest the unlearned, and there
are similarly interesting writers on history and travel&mdash;more
perhaps in these two classes than any other. But it remains true
that the vast majority of non-fiction books do not attract, and
were not written with the aim of attracting, the ordinary reader
such as the libraries are now trying to reach. The result is that
the fiction writers are usurping the functions of these
uninteresting scribes and are putting history, science, economics,
biology, medicine&mdash;all sorts of subjects, into fictional
form&mdash;a sufficient answer to any who may think that the
subjects themselves, as distinguished from the manner in which they
are presented, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page139" name=
"page139"></a>[pg 139]</span>are calculated to repel the ordinary
reader. Fiction is thus becoming, if it has not already become, the
sole form of literary expression, so far as the ordinary reader is
concerned. This is interesting; it justifies the large stock of
fiction in public libraries and the large circulation of that
stock. It does not follow that it is commendable or desirable. For
one thing it places truth and falsehood precisely on the same
plane. The science or the economics in a good novel may be bad and
that in a poor novel may be good. Then again, it dilutes the
interesting matter with triviality. It is right that those who want
to know how and when and under what circumstances Edwin and
Angelina concluded to get married should have an opportunity of
doing so, but it is obviously unfair that the man who likes the
political discussions put into the mouth of Edwin&rsquo;s uncle, or
the clever descriptions of country-life incident to the courtship,
should be burdened with information of this sort, in which he has
little interest.</p>
<p>To those who are interested in the increase of non-fiction
percentages I would therefore say: devise some means of working
upon the authors. These gentry are yet ignorant of the existence of
a special library public. Some day they will wake up, and then
fiction will be relieved from the burden that oppresses it at
present&mdash;of carrying most of the interesting philosophy,
religion, history and social science, in addition to doing its own
proper work.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the librarian, who is interested in advertising ideas,
must do what he can with his material. There is still a saving
remnant of interesting non-fiction, and there is a goodly body of
readers whose antecedent interest in certain subjects is great
enough to attract them to almost any book on those subjects. I have
purposely avoided the discussion <span class="pagenum"><a id=
"page140" name="page140"></a>[pg 140]</span>here of the details of
library publicity, which has been well done elsewhere; but I cannot
refrain from expressing my opinion that the ordinary work of the
library and its stock of books if properly displayed, are more
effective than any other means that can be used for the purpose.
From a series of articles entitled &ldquo;How to Start Libraries in
Small Towns&rdquo; by A.M. Pendleton, I quote the following, which
appears in The Library Journal for May 13, 1877:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Plant it [the library] among the people, where its
presence will be seen and felt,&hellip; Other things being equal,
it is better to have it upon the first floor, so that passers-by
will see its goodly array of books and be tempted to inspect
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Excellent advice; we might take it if we had not built our
libraries as far away from the street as possible and lifted them
up on as high a pedestal as our money would buy. Who, passing by a
modern library building, branch or central, can by any possibility
see through the windows enough of the interior to tell whether it
is a library rather than a postoffice, a bank, or an office?</p>
<p>Before moving into its new home the St. Louis Public Library
occupied temporarily a business building having a row of six large
plate-glass windows on one side, directly on the sidewalk, enabling
passers-by to see clearly all that went on in the adult
lending-delivery room. The effect on the circulation was
noteworthy. During the last months of our occupancy we went further
and utilized each of the windows for a book display. This was in
charge of a special committee of the staff, and its results were
beyond expectation. In one window we had a shelfful of current
books, open to attractive pictures, with a sign reminding wayfarers
that they might be taken out by cardholders and that cards were
free. In another <span class="pagenum"><a id="page141" name=
"page141"></a>[pg 141]</span>we had standard works, without
pictures, but open at attractive pages. In another we had
children&rsquo;s books; in another, open reference or art books in
a dust-proof case&mdash;and so on. Each of these windows was seldom
without its contingent of gazers, and the direct effect on library
circulation was noticed by all. At the end of the year we moved
into our great million-and-a-half-dollar building; and beautiful as
it is&mdash;satisfactory as are its arrangements&mdash;we have
had&mdash;alas&mdash;to give up our show windows. We can, it is
true, have show cases in the great entrance hall, but we want to
attract outsiders, not insiders. Some of our enthusiastic staff
want to build permanent show cases on the sidewalk. What we may
possibly do is to rent real show windows opposite. What we do not
desire, is to abandon our publicity plan altogether. But when, oh
when, shall we have libraries (branches at any rate, if our main
buildings must be monumental) that will throw themselves open to
the public eye, luring in the wayfarer to the joys of reading, as
the commercial window does to the delights of gumdrops or
neckties?</p>
<p>One of the greatest steps ever taken toward the advertisement of
ideas was the adoption, on a large scale, of the open shelf. This
throws the books of a library, or many of them, open to public
inspection and handling; it encourages
&ldquo;browsing&rdquo;&mdash;the somewhat aimless rambling about
and dipping here and there into a volume.</p>
<p>If we are to present ideas to our would-be readers in great
variety, hoping that among them there may be toothsome bait, surely
there could be no better way than this. The only trouble is that it
appeals only to those who are already sufficiently interested in
stored ideas to enter the library.</p>
<p>We must remember, however, that by our method <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page142" name="page142"></a>[pg 142]</span>of
sending out books for home use we are making a great open-shelf of
the whole city. While the number of volumes in any one place may be
small, the books are constantly changing so that the non-reader has
a good chance of seeing in his friend&rsquo;s house something that
may attract him. That this may affect the use of the library it is
essential that he who sees a library book on the table or in the
hands of a fellow passenger on a car must be able to recognize its
source at once, so that, if attracted, he may be led thither by the
suggestion. Nothing is better for this purpose than the library
seal, placed on the book where all may see it; and that all may
recognize it, it should also be used wherever possible, in
connection with the library&mdash;on letter heads, posters, lists,
pockets and cards, so that the public association between its
display and the work of the library shall become strong.</p>
<p>This making the whole outstanding supply of circulating books an
agency in our publicity scheme for ideas is evidently more
effective as the books better fit and satisfy their users; for in
that case we have an unpaid agent with each book. The adaptation of
book to user helps our advertisement of ideas, and that in turn
aids us in adapting book to user. When a dynamo starts, the newly
arisen current makes the field stronger and that in turn increases
the current. Only here we must have just a little residual
magnetism in the field magnet to start the whole process. In the
library&rsquo;s work the residual magnetism is represented by the
latent interest in ideas that is present in every community. And I
can do no better, in closing, than to emphasize the fact that
everything that advertises ideas, even if totally unconnected with
their recorded form in books, helps the library and pushes forward
its work.</p>
<p>Itself a product of the great extension of intellectual
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page143" name="page143"></a>[pg
143]</span>activity to classes in which it was formerly bounded by
narrow limits, the library is bound to widen those limits wherever
they can be stretched, and every movement of them reacts to help
it. Surely advertisement on its part is an evangel&mdash;a bearing
of good intellectual tidings into the darkness. We are
spiritualistic mediums in the best sense&mdash;the bearers of
authentic messages from all the good and great of past or present
time; only with us, no turning on of the light, no publicity
however glaring, will break the spell or do otherwise than aid, for
whether we succeed or fail, whether we live or die, those messages,
recorded as they are in books, will stand while humanity
remains.</p>

<p>The center of a geometrical figure is important, not for its
size and content, but for its position&mdash;not for what it is in
itself, but for its relations to the other elements of the figure.
And words used with derived meanings are used best when their
original significations are kept in mind. The business center of a
city does not contain all of that city&rsquo;s commercial activity;
when we speak of the church as a religious center, we do not mean
that there is to be no religious activity in the home or in other
walks of life; as for the center of population of a large and
populous country, it may be out in the prairie where neither man
nor his dwellings are to be seen. All these centers are what they
are because of certain relationships. It is so with a social
center. But social relationships cover a wide field. The
relationships of business, of religion, even of mere co-existence,
are all social. May we have a center for so wide a range of
activities? Even the narrower relations of business or of religion
tend to form subsidiary groups and to multiply subsidiary centers.
In a large city we may have not only a general business center but
centers of the real estate business, of the hardware or textile
trades, and so on. Our religious affiliations condense into
denominational centers.</p>
<p>In the district of a large city where newly arrived foreign
immigrants gather, you will be shown the group of blocks where the
Poles or the Hungarians <span class="pagenum"><a id="page146" name=
"page146"></a>[pg 146]</span>have segregated themselves from the
rest, and even within these, the houses where dwell families from a
particular province or even from one definite city or village. Man
is social but he is socially clannish, and the broadest is not so
much he who refuses to recognize these clan or caste relationships
as he who enters into the largest number of them&mdash;he who keeps
in touch with his childhood home, has a wide acquaintance among
those of his own religious faith and of his chosen business or
profession, keeps up his old college friendships, is interested in
collecting coins or paintings and knows all the other collectors,
is active in civic and charitable societies, takes an interest in
education and educators, and so on. The social democracy that
should succeed in abolishing all these groups or leveling
them&mdash;that should recognize no relationships but the broader
ones that underly all human effort and feeling&mdash;the touches of
nature that make the whole world kin&mdash;would be barren
indeed.</p>
<p>We cannot spare these fundamentals; we could not get rid of them
if we would; but civilization advances by building upon them, and
to do away with these additions would be like destroying a city to
get at its foundation, in the vain hope of securing some
wide-reaching result in economics or aesthetics. Occupying a
foremost place among these groupings is the large division
embracing our educational activities. And these are social not only
in the broad sense, but also in the narrower. The intercourse of
student with student in the school and even of reader with reader
in the library, especially in such departments as the
children&rsquo;s room, is so obviously that of society that we need
dwell on it no further.</p>
<p>This intercourse, while a necessary incident of education in the
mass, is only an incident. It is sufficiently <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page147" name="page147"></a>[pg
147]</span>obtrusive, however, to make it evident that any use of
school or library building for social purposes is fit and proper.
There is absolutely nothing new nor strange about such use. In
places that cannot afford separate buildings for these purposes,
the same edifice has often served for church, schoolhouse, public
library, and as assembly room for political meetings, amateur
theatricals, and juvenile debating societies. The propriety of all
this has never been questioned and it is difficult to see why it
should not be as proper in a town of 500,000 inhabitants as in one
of 500. The incidence of the cost is a matter of detail. Why should
such purely social use of these educational buildings&mdash;always
common in small towns&mdash;have been allowed to fall into abeyance
in the larger ones? It is hard to say; but with the recent great
improvements in construction, the building of schools and libraries
that are models of beauty, comfort, and convenience, there has
arisen a not unnatural feeling in the public that all this public
property should be put to fuller use. Why should children be forced
to dance on the street or in some place of sordid association when
comfortable and convenient halls in library or school are closed
and unoccupied? Why should the local debating club, the
mothers&rsquo; meeting&mdash;nay, why should the political ward
meeting be barred out? Side by side with this trend of public
opinion there has been an awakening realization on the part of many
connected with these institutions that they themselves might
benefit by such extended use.</p>
<p>Probably this realization has come earlier and more fully to the
library, because its educational function is directed so much more
upon adults. The library is coming to be our great continuation
school&mdash;an institution of learning with an infinity of purely
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page148" name="page148"></a>[pg
148]</span>optional courses. It may open its doors to any form of
adult social activity.</p>
<p>There are forms of activity proper to a social center that
require special apparatus or equipment. These may be furnished in a
building erected for the purpose, as are the Chicago fieldhouses.
Here we have swimming-pools, gymnasiums for men and for women, and
all the rest of it. A branch library is included and some would
house the school also under the same roof. We may have to wait long
for the general adoption of such a composite social center. Our
immediate problem is to supply an immediate need by using means
directly at our disposal. And it is remarkable how many kinds of
neighborhood activity may take place in a room unprovided with any
special equipment. A brief glance over our own records for only a
few months past enables me to classify them roughly as athletic or
outdoor, purely social, educational, debating, political, labor,
musical, religious, charitable or civic, and expository, besides
many that defy or elude classification.</p>
<p>The athletic or outdoor organizations include the various
turning or gymnastic clubs and the Boy and Girl Scouts; the social
organizations embrace dancing-classes, &ldquo;welfare&rdquo;
associations, alumni and graduate clubs of schools and colleges,
and dramatic clubs; the educational, which are very numerous,
reading circles, literary clubs galore, free classes in chemistry,
French, psychology, philosophy, etc., and all such organizations as
the Jewish Culture Club, the Young People&rsquo;s Ethical Society,
the Longan Parliamentary Class, and the Industrial and Business
Women&rsquo;s Educational leagues. Religious bodies are parish
meetings, committees of mission boards, and such organizations as
the Theosophical Society; charitable or <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page149" name="page149"></a>[pg 149]</span>civic
activities include the National Conference of Day Nurseries, the
Central Council of Civic Agencies, the W.C.T.U., playground
rehearsals for the Child Welfare Exhibit, and the Business
Men&rsquo;s Association; and the Advertising Men&rsquo;s League;
musical organizations embrace St. Paul&rsquo;s Musical Assembly,
the Tuesday Choral Club, etc. Among exhibitions are local affairs
such as wild flower shows, an exhibit of bird-houses, collections
from the Educational Museum, the Civil League&rsquo;s Municipal
Exhibit, selected screens from the Child Welfare Exhibit, and the
prize-winners from the St. Louis Art Exhibit held in the art room
of our central library. Then we have the Queen Hedwig Branch, the
Clay School Picnic Association, the Aero Club, the Lithuanian Club,
the Philotechne Club, the Fathers&rsquo; Club, and the United
Spanish War Veterans.</p>
<p>I trust you will not call upon me to explain the objects of some
of these, as such a demand might cause me embarrassment&mdash;not
because their aims are unworthy, but because these are skilfully
obscured by their names. If anyone believes that there is a limit
to the capacity of the human race for forming groups and subgroups
on a moment&rsquo;s notice, for any reason or for no reason at all,
I would refer him to our assembly room and clubroom records; and he
would find, I think, that these are typical of every large library
offering the use of such rooms somewhat freely.</p>
<p>It will be noted that the library takes no part in organizing or
operating any of these activities; it does not have to do so.</p>
<p>The successful leader is he who repairs to a hill and raises his
standard, knowing that at sight of it followers will flock around
him. When you drop a tiny crystal into a solution, the atoms all
rush to it <span class="pagenum"><a id="page150" name=
"page150"></a>[pg 150]</span>naturally: there is no effort or
compulsion except that of the aptitudes that their Creator has
implanted in them. So it is with all centers, business or religious
or social. No one instituted a campaign to locate the business
center of a city at precisely such a square or corner. Things
aggregate, and the point to which they tend is their center; they
make it, it does not make them. The leader on a hill is a leader
because he has followers; without them he would be but a lone
warrior. The school or the library that says proudly to itself,
&ldquo;Go to; I will be a social center,&rdquo; may find itself in
the same lonely position. It can offer an opportunity: that is all.
It can offer houseroom to clubs, organizations, and groups of all
kinds, whether permanent or temporary, large or small, but its
usefulness as a social center depends largely on the existence of
these and on their desire for a meeting place. We have in St. Louis
six branch libraries with assembly rooms and clubrooms&mdash;in all
a dozen or so. I have before me the calendar for a single week and
I find 55 engagements, running from 24 at one branch down thru 13,
8, 6, and 3 to one. If I had before me only the largest number I
should conclude that branch libraries as social centers were a
howling success; if only the smallest, I should say that they were
dismal failures. Why the difference? For the same reason that the
leader who displays his standard may or may not be surrounded with
eager &ldquo;flocking&rdquo; followers. There may be no one within
earshot, or they may have no stomach for the war, or they may not
be interested in the cause that he represents. Or again, he may not
shout loud or persuasively enough, or his standard may not be
attractive enough in form or color, or mounted on a sufficiently
high staff.</p>
<p>I have said that all we can offer is opportunity; to
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page151" name="page151"></a>[pg
151]</span>change our figure, we can furnish the
drinking-fountain&mdash;thirst must bring the horse to it. But we
must not forget that we offer our opportunity in vain unless we are
sure that everyone who might grasp it realizes our offer and what
it means.</p>
<p>Here is the chance for personal endeavor. If the young people in
a neighborhood continue to hold their social meetings over a saloon
when the branch library or the school is perfectly willing to offer
its assembly room, it is pretty certain that they do not understand
that offer, or that they mistrust its sincerity, or that there is
something wrong that might be remedied by personal effort. In the
one of our branches that is most used by organizations there is
this personal touch. But I should hesitate to say that the others
do not have it too. There are plenty of organizations near this
busiest library and there are no other good places for them to
meet. In the neighborhood of some other branches there are other
meeting-places, and elsewhere, perhaps, the social instinct is not
so strong, or at any rate the effort to organize is lacking. Should
the librarian step out and attempt to stimulate this social
instinct and to guide this organizing effort? There is room for
difference of opinion here.</p>
<p>Personally I think that he should not do it directly and
officially as a librarian. He may do it quietly and unobtrusively
like any other private citizen, but he needs all his efforts, all
his influence, to bring the book and the reader together in his
community. Sometimes by doing this he can be doing the other too,
and he can always do it vicariously. He should bear in mind that
the successful man is not he who does everything himself, but he
who can induce others to do things&mdash;to do them in his way and
to direct them <span class="pagenum"><a id="page152" name=
"page152"></a>[pg 152]</span>toward his ends. Even in the most
sluggish, the most indifferent community there are these potential
workers with enthusiasms that need only to be awakened to be let
loose for good. The magic key is often in the librarian&rsquo;s
girdle, and his free offer of house room and sympathy, with good
literature thrown in, will always be of powerful assistance in this
kind of effort. He will seldom need to do more than to make clear
the existence and the nature of the opportunity that he offers. I
know that there are some librarians and many more teachers who
hesitate to open their doors in any such way as this; who are
afraid that the opportunities offered will be misused or that the
activities so sheltered will be misjudged by the public. It has
shocked some persons that a young people&rsquo;s dancing-class has
been held, under irreproachable auspices, in one of our branch
libraries; others have been grieved to see that political ward
meetings have taken place in them, and that some rather radical
political theories have been debated there. These persons forget
that a library never takes sides. It places on its shelves books on
the Civil War from the standpoint of both North and South,
histories of the great religious controversies by both Catholics
and Protestants, ideas and theories in science and philosophy from
all sides and at all angles. It may give room at one time to a
young people&rsquo;s dancing-class and at another to a meeting of
persons who condemn dancing. Its walls may echo one day to the
praises of our tariff system and on another to fierce denunciations
of it.</p>
<p>These things are all legitimate and it is better that they
should take place in a library or a school building than in a
saloon or even in a grocery store. The influence of environment is
gently pervasive. I may be wrong, but I cannot help thinking that
it is <span class="pagenum"><a id="page153" name="page153"></a>[pg
153]</span>easier to be a gentleman in a library, whether in social
meeting or in political debate, than it is in some other places. In
one of our branches there meets a club of men who would be termed
anarchists by some people. The branch librarian assures me that the
brand of anarchism that they profess has grown perceptibly milder
since they have met in the library. It is getting to be literary,
academic, philosophic. Nourished in a saloon, with a little
injudicious repression, it might perhaps have borne fruit of bombs
and dynamite.</p>
<p>In this catholicity I cannot help thinking that the library as
an educational institution is a step ahead of the school. Most
teachers would resent the imputation of partisanship on the part of
the school, and yet it is surely partisan&mdash;in some ways
rightly and inevitably so. One cannot well explain both sides of
any question to a child of six and leave its decision to his
judgment. This is obvious; and yet I cannot help thinking that
there is one-sided teaching of children who are at least old enough
to know that there is another side, and that the one-sided teaching
of two-sided subjects might be postponed in some cases until
two-sided information would be possible and proper. Where a child
is taught one side and finds out later that there is another, his
resentment is apt to be bitter; it spoils the educational effect of
much that he was taught and injures the influence of the
institution that taught him. My resentment is still strong against
the teaching that hid from me the southern viewpoint concerning
slavery and secession, the Catholic viewpoint of what we
Protestants call the Reformation&mdash;dozens of things omitted
from textbooks on dozens of subjects because they did not happen to
meet the approval of the textbook compiler. I am no less
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page154" name="page154"></a>[pg
154]</span>an opponent of slavery&mdash;I am no less a
Protestant&mdash;because I know the other side, but I think I am a
better man for knowing it, and I think it a thousand pities that
there are thousands of our fellow citizens, on all sides of all
possible lines, from whom our educative processes have hid even the
fact that there is another side. This question, as I have said,
does not affect the library, and fortunately need not affect it.
And as we are necessarily two-sided in our book material so we can
open our doors to free social or neighborhood use without bothering
our heads about whether the users are Catholics, Protestants, or
Jews; Democrats, Republicans, or Socialists; Christian Scientists
or suffragists. The library hands our suffrage and anti-suffrage
literature to its users with the same smile, and if it hands the
anti-suffrage books to the suffragist, and vice versa, both sides
are certainly the better for it.</p>
<p>I have tried to make it clear in what I have said that in this
matter of social activity, public institutions should go as far as
they can in furnishing facilities without taking upon themselves
the burden of administration. I believe fully in municipal
ownership of all kinds of utilities, but rarely in municipal
operation. Municipal ownership safeguards the city, and private or
corporate operation avoids the numerous objections to close
municipal control of detail. So the library authorities may retain
sufficient control of these social activities by the power that
they have of admitting them to the parts of the buildings provided
for them, or of excluding them at any time. These activities
themselves are better managed by voluntary bodies, and, as I have
said, there is no indication that the formation of such bodies is
on the wane. The establishment and operation of a musical or
athletic <span class="pagenum"><a id="page155" name=
"page155"></a>[pg 155]</span>club, a debating society, or a Boy
Scouts company, are surely quite as educational as the activities
themselves in which their members engage. Do not let us arrogate to
ourselves such opportunities as these. I should be inclined to take
this attitude also with regard to the public playgrounds, were they
not somewhat without the province of this paper; and I take it very
strongly with regard to the public school. Throw open the school
buildings as soon as you can, and as freely as you can to every
legitimate form of social activity, but let your relationship to
this activity be like that of the center to the circle&mdash;in it
and of it, but embracing no part of its areal content. So, I am
convinced, will it be best for all of us&mdash;for ourselves, the
administrators of public property, and for the public, the owning
body which is now demanding that it should not be barred out by its
servants from that property&rsquo;s freest and fullest use.</p>

<h2><a name="Essay14" id="Essay14">The Systematization of
Violence</a></h2>
<p class="returnTOC"><a href="#Contents">Return to Table of
Contents</a></p>
<p>The peace propaganda has suffered much from the popular
impression that many of those engaged in it are impractical
enthusiasts who are assuming the possibility of doing away with
passions and prejudices incident to our very humanity, and of
bringing about an ideal reign of love and good will. Whether this
impression is or is not justified we need not now inquire. It is
the impression itself that is injuring the cause of peace, and will
continue to injure it until it is removed.</p>
<p>It may at least be lessened by allowing the mind to dwell for a
time on another aspect of the subject in which the regime of peace
that would follow the discontinuance of all settlement of disputes
by violence will appear to consist not so much in the total
disappearance of violence from the earth as in the use of it for a
different purpose, namely, the preservation of the peaceful status
quo, by a systematic and lawful use of force, or at any rate, the
readiness to employ it.</p>
<p>A state of peace, whether between individuals or nations,
whether without or within a regime of law, always partakes of the
nature of an armed truce: under one regime, however, the arms are
borne by the possible contestants themselves; under the other, by
the community whose members they are. If there is a resort to arms,
violence ensues under both regimes; in both cases it tends
ultimately to restore peace, but the action is more certain and
more systematic when the violence is exerted by the community.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page158" name="page158"></a>[pg
158]</span>These laws may apply indifferently to a community of
individuals or to one of nations. The most cogent and the most
valid argument at the disposal of the peace advocate is the fact
that we no longer allow the individual to take the law into his own
hand, and that logically we should equally prohibit the nation from
doing so. This is unanswerable, but its force has been greatly
weakened by the assumption, which it requires no great astuteness
to find unwarranted, that the settlement of individual quarrels by
individual force has resulted from&mdash;or at least resulted
in&mdash;the discontinuance of violence altogether, or in the dawn
of a general era of good-will, man to man. On the contrary, it is
very doubtful whether there is less violence to-day than there
would be if the operation of law were suspended altogether; the
difference, is that the violence has shifted its incidence and
altered its aim&mdash;it is civic and social and no longer
individual.</p>
<p>If we are to introduce the regime of law among nations as among
individuals, our first step must be similarly to shift the
incidence of violence. In so doing we may not decrease it, we may,
indeed, increase it&mdash;but we shall none the less be taking that
step in the only possible direction to achieve our purpose.</p>
<p>Among individuals, custom, crystallizing into law, generally
precedes the enforcement of that law by the community. Hence, a
somewhat elaborate code may exist side by side with the settlement
of disputes, under that code, by personal combat. We have among
nations such a code, and we yet admit the settlement of disputes by
war, because the incidence of violence has not yet completely
shifted. We have established a tribunal to act, in certain cases,
on behalf of the community of nations, but we have not <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page159" name="page159"></a>[pg 159]</span>yet
given that tribunal complete jurisdiction and we have given it no
power whatever to enforce its decrees. It is on this latter point
that I desire to dwell. In a community of individuals, there are
two ways of using violence to enforce law&mdash;by the professional
police force and by the posse of citizens. The former is more
effective, but the latter is often readier and more certain in
particular instances, especially in primitive communities. To give
it force we must have readiness on the part of every citizen to
respond to a call from the proper officer, and ability to do
effective service, especially by the possession of arms and skill
in their use. These requisites are not generally found in more
advanced communities.</p>
<p>In like manner, the decrees of an international tribunal might
be enforced either by the creation of an international army or by
calling upon as many of the nations as necessary to aid in coercing
the non-law-abiding member of the international community. Each
nation is already armed and ready.</p>
<p>Whatever may be thought of the ultimate possibility of an
international army, it must be evident that the principle of the
posse must serve us at the outset. An international army would
always consist in part of members of the nation to be coerced,
whereas, in selecting a posse those furthest in race and in
sympathy from the offender might always be chosen, just as members
of a hostile clan would make up the best posse to arrest a
Highlander for sheep-stealing.</p>
<p>Moreover, the posse has been used internationally more than
once, as when decrees have been pronounced by a general European
Congress and some particular nation or nations have been charged
with their execution.</p>
<p>When a frontier community that has been a law unto itself gets
its first sheriff, the earliest visible result <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page160" name="page160"></a>[pg 160]</span>is not
impossibly a sudden increase, instead of a decrease, of violence.
There is a war of the community, represented by the sheriff and the
good citizens, against all the bad ones. Even so it may be expected
that among the first results of an effective agreement to enforce
the decrees of an international tribunal, would be an exceptionally
great and violent war. Sooner or later some nation would be sure to
take issue with an unpopular decree and refuse to obey it. This
would probably be one of the larger and more powerful nations, for
a weaker power would not proceed to such lengths in protest.</p>
<p>Not improbably other nations might join the protesting power.
The result would be a war; it might even be the world war that we
have been fearing for a generation. It might conceivably be the
greatest and the bloodiest war that the world has yet seen. Yet it
would be far the most glorious war of history, for it would be a
struggle on behalf of law and order in the community of
nations&mdash;a fight to uphold that authority by whose exercise
alone may peace be assured to the world. The man who shudders at
the prospect of such a war, who wants peace, but is unwilling to
fight for it, should cease his efforts on behalf of a universal
agreement among nations, for there is no general agreement without
power to quell dissension.</p>
<p>This is not the place to discuss the details of an international
agreement to enforce the decrees of an international tribunal. It
may merely be said that if the most powerful and intelligent
communities of men that have ever existed cannot devise machinery
to do what puny individuals have long been successfully
accomplishing, they had better disband and coalesce in universal
anarchy.</p>
<p>My object here is neither to propose plans nor to <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page161" name="page161"></a>[pg 161]</span>discuss
details, but merely to point out that not the abandonment, but the
systematization of violence is the goal of a rational peace
propaganda, and that when this is once acknowledged and universally
realized, an important step will have been taken toward winning
over a class of persons who now oppose a world-peace as impractical
and impossible.</p>
<p>These persons disapprove of disarmament: and from the point of
view here advocated, a general disarmament would be the last thing
to be desired. The possible member of a posse must bear arms to be
effective. Armaments may have to be limited and controlled by
international decree, but to disarm a nation would be as criminal
and foolish as it would be to take away all weapons from the
law-abiding citizens of a mining town as a preliminary to calling
upon them to assist in the arrest of a notorious band of
outlaws.</p>
<p>Again: a common objection to the peace propaganda is that
without war we shall have none of the heroic virtues that war calls
into being. This objection fails utterly when we consider that what
we shall get under a proper international agreement is not the
abolition of war, but simply an assurance that when there is a war
it will be one in which every good citizen can take at once the
part of international law and order&mdash;a contest between the law
and the law-breaker, and not one in which both contestants are
equally lawless. Thus the profession of arms will still be an
honorable one&mdash;it will, in fact, be much more honorable than
it is to-day, when it may at any moment be prostituted to the
service of greed or commercialism.</p>

<h2><a name="Essay15" id="Essay15">The Art of Re-reading</a></h2>
<p class="returnTOC"><a href="#Contents">Return to Table of
Contents</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;I have nothing to read,&rdquo; said a man to me once.
&ldquo;But your house seems to be filled with books.&rdquo;
&ldquo;O, yes; but I&rsquo;ve read them already.&rdquo; What should
we think of a man who should complain that he had no friends, when
his house was thronged daily with guests, simply because he had
seen and talked with them all once before? Such a man has either
chosen badly, or he is himself at fault. &ldquo;Hold fast that
which is good&rdquo; says the Scripture. Do not taste it once and
throw it away. To get at the root of this matter we must go farther
back than literature and inquire what it has in common with all
other forms of art to compel our love and admiration. Now, a work
of art differs from any other result of human endeavor in
this&mdash;that its effect depends chiefly on the way in which it
is made and only secondarily upon what it is or what it represents.
Were this not true, all statues of Apollo or Venus would have the
same art-value; and you or I, if we could find a tree and a hill
that Corot had painted, would be able to produce a picture as
charming to the beholder as his.</p>
<p>The way in which a thing is done is, of course, always
important, but its importance outside of the sphere of art differs
from that within. The way in which a machine is constructed makes
it good or bad, but the thing that is aimed at here is the useful
working of the machine, toward which all the skill of the maker is
directed. What the artist aims at is not so much to produce a
likeness of a god or a picture of a tree, as to produce certain
effects in the person who looks at his complete work; and this he
does by the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page164" name=
"page164"></a>[pg 164]</span>way in which he performs it. The fact
that a painting represents certain trees and hills is here only
secondary; the primary fact is what the artist has succeeded in
making the on-looker feel.</p>
<p>While Sorolla is painting a group of children on the beach, I
may take a kodak picture of the same group. My photograph may be a
better likeness than Sorolla&rsquo;s picture, but it has no
art-value. Why? Because it was made mechanically, whereas Sorolla
put into his picture something of himself, making it a unique
thing, incapable of imitation or of reproduction.</p>
<p>The man who has a message, one of those pervasive, compelling
messages that are worth while, naturally turns to art. He chooses
his subject not as an end, but as a vehicle, and he makes it speak
his message by his method of treatment, conveying it to his public
more or less successfully in the measure of his skill.</p>
<p>We have been speaking of the representative arts of painting and
sculpture, but the same is true of art in any form. In music, not a
representative art, in spite of the somewhat grotesque claims of
so-called program music, the method of the composer is everything,
or at least his subject is so vague and immaterial that no one
would think of exalting it as an end in itself. There is, however,
an art in which the subject stands forth so prominently that even
those who love the art itself are continually in danger of
forgetting the subject&rsquo;s secondary character. I mean the art
of literature. Among the works of written speech the boundaries of
art are much more ill-defined than they are elsewhere. There is, to
be sure, as much difference between Shelley&rsquo;s &ldquo;Ode to a
Skylark&rdquo; and Todhunter&rsquo;s &ldquo;Trigonometry&rdquo; as
there is between the Venus de Milo and a battleship; and I conceive
that <span class="pagenum"><a id="page165" name="page165"></a>[pg
165]</span>the difference is also of precisely the same kind, being
that by which, as we have seen above, we may always discriminate
between a work of art and one of utility. But where art-value and
utility are closely combined, as they are most frequently in
literature, it is, I believe, more difficult to divide them
mentally and to dwell on their separate characteristics, than where
the work is a concrete object. This is why we hear so many disputes
about whether a given work does or does not belong to the realm of
&ldquo;pure literature,&rdquo; and it is also the reason why, as I
have said, some, even among those who love literature, are not
always ready to recognize its nature as an art, or mistakenly
believe that in so far as its art-value is concerned, the subject
portrayed is of primary importance&mdash;is an aim in itself
instead of being a mere vehicle for the conveyance of an
impression.</p>
<p>Take, if you please, works which were intended by their authors
as works of utility, but have survived as works of art in spite of
themselves, such as Walton&rsquo;s &ldquo;Compleat Angler&rdquo;
and White&rsquo;s &ldquo;Natural History of Selborne.&rdquo; Will
anyone maintain that the subject-matter of those books has much to
do with their preservation, or with the estimation in which they
are now held? Nay; we may even be so bold as to enter the field of
fiction and to assert that those fictional works that have purely
literary value are loved not for the story they tell, but for the
way in which the author tells it and for the effect that he thereby
produces on the reader.</p>
<p>I conceive that pure literature is an art, subject to the rules
that govern all art, and that its value depends primarily on the
effect produced on the reader&mdash;the message conveyed&mdash;by
the way in which the writer has done his work, the subject chosen
being only his vehicle. Where a man who has something to
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page166" name="page166"></a>[pg
166]</span>say looks about for means to say it worthily, he may
select a tale, a philosophical disquisition, a familiar essay, a
drama or a lyric poem. He may choose badly or well, but in any case
it is his message that matters.</p>
<p>My excuse for dwelling on this matter must be that unless I have
carried you with me thus far what I am about to say will have no
meaning, and I had best fold my papers, make my bow, and conclude
an unprofitable business. For my subject is re-reading, the
repetition of a message; and the message that we would willingly
hear repeated is not that of utility but of emotion. It is the word
that thrills the heart, nerves the arm, and puts new life into the
veins, not that which simply conveys information. The former will
produce its effect again and again, custom can not stale it. The
latter, once delivered, has done its work. I see two messengers
approaching; one, whom I have sent to a library to ascertain the
birth-date of Oliver Cromwell, tells me what it is and receives my
thanks. The other tells me that one dear to my heart, long lying at
death&rsquo;s door, is recovering. My blood courses through my
veins; my nerves tingle; joy suffuses me where gloom reigned
before. I cry out; I beg the bearer of good tidings to tell them
again and again; I keep him by me, so that I may ask him a thousand
questions, bringing out his message in a thousand variant forms.
But do I turn to the other and say, &ldquo;O, that blessed date!
was Cromwell truly born thereon? Let me, I pray, hear you recite it
again and again!&rdquo; I trow, not.</p>
<p>The message that we desire to hear again is the one that
produces its effect again and again; and that is the message of
feeling, the message of art&mdash;not that of mere utility. This is
so true that I conceive we may use it as a test of art-value. The
great works of literature do not lose their effect on a single
reading. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page167" name=
"page167"></a>[pg 167]</span>One makes response to them the
hundredth time as he did the first. Their appeal is so compelling
that there is no denying it&mdash;no resisting it. There are
snatches of poetry&mdash;and of prose, too&mdash;that we have by
heart; that we murmur to ourselves again and again, sure that the
response which never failed will come again, thrilling the whole
organism with its pathos, uplifting us with the nobility of its
appeal, warming us with its humor. There is a little sequence of
homely verse that never fails to bring the tears to my eyes. I have
tested myself with it under the most unfavorable circumstances. In
the midst of business, amid social jollity, in the mental dullness
of fatigue, I have stopped and repeated to myself those three
verses. So quickly acts the magic of the author&rsquo;s skill that
the earlier verses grip the fibers of my mind and twist them in
such fashion that I feel the pathos of the last lines just as I
felt them for the first time, years ago. You might all tell similar
stories. I believe that this is a characteristic of good
literature, and that all of it will bear reading, and re-reading,
and reading again.</p>
<p>But I hear someone say, &ldquo;Do you mean to tell me that those
three little verses that bring the tears to your eyes, will bring
them also to mine and my neighbor&rsquo;s? I might listen to them
appreciatively but dry-eyed; my neighbor might not care for them
enough to re-read them once. All about us we see this personal
equation in the appreciation of literature. Unless you are
prepared, then, to maintain that literature may be good for one and
bad for another, your contention will scarcely hold
water.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Even so, brother. The messenger who told me of the safety of my
dear one did not thrill your heart as he did mine. She was dear to
me, not to you, and the infinitely delicate yet powerful chain of
conditions <span class="pagenum"><a id="page168" name=
"page168"></a>[pg 168]</span>and relations that operated between
the messenger&rsquo;s voice and my emotional nature did not connect
him with yours. Assuredly, the message that reaches one man may not
reach another. It may even reach a man in his youth and fall short
in manhood, or vice versa. It may be good for him and inoperative
on all the rest of the world. We estimate literature, it is true,
by the universality of its appeal or by the character of the
persons whom alone that appeal reaches. The message of literature
as art may thus be to the crowd or to a select few. I could even
imagine intellect and feeling of such exquisite fineness, such
acknowledged superiority, that appeal to it alone might be enough
to fix the status of a work of art, though it might leave all
others cold. Still, in general I believe, that the greatest
literature appeals to the greatest number and to the largest number
of types. I believe that there are very few persons to whom
Shakespeare, properly presented, will not appeal. In him,
nevertheless, the learned and those of taste also delight. There
are authors like Walter Pater who are a joy to the few but do not
please the many. There are others galore, whom perhaps it would be
invidious to name, who inspire joy in the multitude but only
distaste in the more discriminating. We place Pater above these,
just as we should always put quality above quantity; but I place
Shakespeare vastly higher, because his appeal is to the few and the
many at once.</p>
<p>But we must, I think, acknowledge that an author whose value may
not appeal to others may be great to one reader; that his influence
on that reader may be as strong for good as if it were universal
instead of unique. We may not place such a writer in the Walhalla,
but I beseech you, do not let us tear him rudely from the one or
two to whom he is good and great. <span class="pagenum"><a id=
"page169" name="page169"></a>[pg 169]</span>Do not lop off the
clinging arms at the elbow, but rather skilfully present some other
object of adoration to the intent that they may voluntarily untwine
and enfold this new object more worthily.</p>
<p>The man who desires to own books but who can afford only a small
and select library can not do better than to make his selection on
this basis&mdash;to get together a collection of well-loved books
any one of which would give him pleasure in re-reading. Why should
a man harbor in his house a book that he has read once and never
cares to read again? Why should he own one that he will never care
to read at all? We are not considering the books of the great
collectors, coveted for their rarity or their early dates, for
their previous ownership or the beauty of their binding&mdash;for
any reason except the one that makes them books rather than
curiosities. These collections are not libraries in the
intellectual or the literary sense. Three well thumbed volumes in
the attic of one who loves them are a better library for him than
those on which Pierpont Morgan spent his millions.</p>
<p>This advice, it will be noted, implies that the man has an
opportunity to read the book before he decides whether to buy it or
not. Here is where the Public Library comes in. Some regard the
Public Library as an institution to obviate all necessity of owning
books. It should rather be regarded from our present standpoint as
an institution to enable readers to own the books that they
need&mdash;to survey the field and make therefrom a proper and
well-considered selection. That it has acted so in the past, none
may doubt; it is the business of librarians to see that this
function is emphasized in the future. The bookseller and the
librarian are not rivals, but co-workers. Librarians complain of
the point of view of those publishers <span class="pagenum"><a id=
"page170" name="page170"></a>[pg 170]</span>and dealers who regard
every library user as a lost customer. He is rather, they say, in
many cases a customer won&mdash;a non-reader added to the reading
class&mdash;a possible purchaser of books. But have not librarians
shared somewhat this mistaken and intolerant attitude? How often do
we urge our readers to become book-owners? How often do we give
them information and aid directed toward this end? The success of
the Christmas book exhibitions held in many libraries should be a
lesson to us. The lists issued in connection with these almost
always include prices, publishers&rsquo; names, and other
information intended especially for the would-be purchaser. But why
should we limit our efforts to the holiday season? True, every
librarian does occasionally respond to requests for advice in
book-selection and book-purchase, but the library is not yet
recognized as the great testing field of the would-be book owner;
the librarian is not yet hailed as the community&rsquo;s expert
adviser in the selection and purchase of books, as well as its book
guardian and book distributor. That this may be and should be, I
believe. It will be if the librarian wills it.</p>
<p>Are we straying from our subject? No; for from our present
standpoint a book bought is a book reread. My ideal private library
is a room, be it large or small, lined with books, every one of
which is the owner&rsquo;s familiar friend, some almost known by
heart, others re-read many times, others still waiting to be
re-read.</p>
<p>But how about the man whose first selection for this intimate
personal group would be a complete set of the works of George Ade?
Well, if that is his taste, let his library reflect it. Let a man
be himself. That there is virtue in merely surrounding oneself with
the great masters of literature all unread and unloved, I
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page171" name="page171"></a>[pg
171]</span>can not see. Better acknowledge your poor taste than be
a hypocrite.</p>
<p>The librarian can not force the classics down the unwilling
throats of those who do not care for them and are perhaps unfitted
to appreciate them. There has been entirely too much of this
already and it has resulted disastrously. Surely, a sane via media
is possible, and we may agree that a man will never like Eschylus,
without assuring him that Eschylus is an out-of-date old fogy,
while on the other hand we may acknowledge the greatness of Homer
and Milton without trying to force them upon unwilling and
incompetent readers. After all it is not so much a question of
Milton versus George Ade, as it is of sanity and wholesomeness
against vulgarity and morbidity. And if I were to walk through one
city and behold collections of this latter sort predominating and
then through another, where my eyes were gladdened with evidences
of good taste, of love for humor that is wholesome, sentiment that
is sane, verse that is tuneful and noble, I should at once call on
the public librarian and I should say to him, &ldquo;Thou art the
man!&rdquo; The literary taste of your community is a reflection of
your own as shown forth in your own institution&mdash;its
collection of books, the assistants with which you have surrounded
yourself, your attitude and theirs through you toward literature
and toward the public.</p>
<p>But, someone asks, suppose that I am so fortunate and so happy
as to sit in the midst of such a group of friendly authors; how and
how often shall I re-read? Shall I traverse the group every year?
He who speaks thus is playing a part; he is not the real thing.
Does the young lover ask how and how often he shall go to see his
sweetheart? Try to see whether you can keep him away! The
book-lover reopens his favorite volume whenever he feels like it.
Among the works <span class="pagenum"><a id="page172" name=
"page172"></a>[pg 172]</span>on his shelves are books for every
mood, every shade of varying temper and humor. He chooses for the
moment the friend that best corresponds to it, or it may be, the
one that may best woo him away from it. It may be that he will
select none of them, but occupy himself with a pile of newcomers,
some of whom may be candidates for admission to the inner group.
The whole thing&mdash;the composition of his library, his attitude
toward it, the books that he re-reads oftenest, the favorite
passages that he loves, that he scans fondly with his eye while yet
he can repeat them by heart, his standards of admission to his
inner circle&mdash;all is peculiarly and personally his own. There
is no other precisely like it, just as there is no other human
being precisely like its owner. There is as much difference between
this kind of a library and some that we have seen as there is
between a live, breathing creature with a mind and emotions and
aspirations, and a wax figure in the Eden Musee.</p>
<p>Thus every book lover re-reads his favorites in a way of his
own, just as every individual human being loves or hates or mourns
or rejoices in a way of his own.</p>
<p>One can no more describe these idiosyncrasies than he can write
a history of all the individuals in the world, but perhaps, in the
manner of the ethnological or zoological classifier, it may
interest us to glance at the types of a few genera or species.</p>
<p>And first, please note that re-reading is the exact repetition
of a dual mental experience, so far at least as one of the minds is
concerned. It is a replica of mind-contact, under conditions
obtainable nowhere else in this world and of such nature that some
of them seem almost to partake of other-worldliness. My
yesterday&rsquo;s interview with Smith or Jones, trivial as it is,
I can not repeat. Smith can not remember <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page173" name="page173"></a>[pg 173]</span>what he
said, and even if he could, he could not say it to me in the same
way and to the same purpose. But my interview with Plato&mdash;with
Shakespeare, with Emerson; my talk with Julius Caesar, with Goethe,
with Lincoln! I can duplicate it once, twice, a hundred times. My
own mind&mdash;one party to the contact&mdash;may change, but
Plato&rsquo;s or Lincoln&rsquo;s is ever the same; they speak no
&ldquo;various language&rdquo; like Byrant&rsquo;s nature, but are
like that great Author of Nature who has taken them to Himself, in
that in them &ldquo;is no variableness, neither shadow of
turning.&rdquo; To realize that these men may speak to me today,
across the abyss of time, and that I can count on the same message
tomorrow, next year and on my death bed, in the same authentic
words, producing the same effect, assures me that somewhere,
somehow, a miracle has been wrought.</p>
<p>I have said that one of the minds that come thus into contact
changes not, while the other, the reader&rsquo;s, is alterable.
This gives him a sort of standard by which he can measure or at
least estimate, the changes that go on within him, the temporary
ones due to fluctuations in health, strength or temper, the
progressive ones due to natural growth or to outside
influences.</p>
<p>In his &ldquo;Introduction to Don Quixote,&rdquo; Heine tells us
how that book, the first that he ever read, was his mental
companion through life. In that first perusal knowing not
&ldquo;how much irony God had interwoven into the world,&rdquo; he
looked upon the luckless knight as a real hero of romance and wept
bitterly when his chivalry and generosity met with ingratitude and
violence. A little later, when the satire dawned upon his
comprehension, he could not bear the book. Still later he read it
with contemptuous laughter at the poor knight. But when in later
life, he lay racked on <span class="pagenum"><a id="page174" name=
"page174"></a>[pg 174]</span>a bed of pain his attitude of sympathy
returned. &ldquo;Dulcinea del Toboso,&rdquo; he says &ldquo;is
still the most beautiful woman in the world; although I lie
stretched upon the earth, helpless and miserable, I will never take
back that assertion. I can not do otherwise. On with your lances,
ye Knights of the Silver Moon; ye disguised barbers!&rdquo;</p>
<p>So every reader&rsquo;s viewpoint shifts with the years.</p>
<p>Our friend who welcomes George Ade to his inner sanctuary may
find as the years go on that his reaction to that contact has
altered. I should not recommend that the author be then be cast
into outer darkness. Once a favorite, always a favorite, for old
sake&rsquo;s sake even if not for present power and influence. Our
private libraries will hold shelf after shelf of these old-time
favorites&mdash;milestones on the intellectual track over which we
have wearily or joyously traveled.</p>
<p>There will always be a warm spot in my heart and a nook on my
private shelf for Oliver Optic and Horatio Alger. Though I bar them
from my library (I mean my Library with a big L) I have no right to
exclude them from my private collection of favorites, for once I
loved them. I scarcely know why or how. If there had been in those
far-off days of my boyhood, children&rsquo;s libraries and
children&rsquo;s librarians, I might not have known them; as it is,
they are incidents in my literary past that can not be blinked,
shameful though they may be. The re-reading of such books as these
is interesting because it shows us how far we have traveled since
we counted them among our favorites.</p>
<p>Then there is the book that, despite its acknowledged
excellence, the reader would not perhaps admit to his inner circle
if he read it now for the first time. <span class="pagenum"><a id=
"page175" name="page175"></a>[pg 175]</span>It holds its place
largely on account of the glamour with which his youth invested it.
It thrills him now as it thrilled him then, but he half suspects
that the thrill is largely reminiscent. I sometimes fancy that as I
re-read Ivanhoe and my heart leaps to my mouth when the knights
clash at Ashby, the propulsive power of that leap had its origin in
the emotions of 1870 rather than those of 1914. And when some of
Dickens&rsquo; pathos&mdash;that death-bed of Paul Dombey for
instance&mdash;brings the tears again unbidden to my eyes, I
suspect, though I scarcely dare to put my suspicion into words,
that the salt in those tears is of the vintage of 1875. I am
reading Arnold Bennett now and loving him very dearly when he is at
his best; but how I shall feel about him in 1930 or how I might
feel if I could live until 2014, is another question.</p>
<p>Then there is the book that, scarce comprehended or appreciated
when it was first read, but loved for some magic of expression or
turn of thought, shows new beauties at each re-reading, unfolding
like an opening rose and bringing to view petals of beauty, wit,
wisdom and power that were before unsuspected. This is the kind of
book that one loves most to re-read, for the growth that one sees
in it is after all in oneself&mdash;not in the book. The gems that
you did not see when you read it first were there then as they are
now. You saw them not then and you see them now, for your mental
sight is stronger&mdash;you are more of a man now than you were
then.</p>
<p>Not that all the changes of the years are necessarily for the
better. They may be neither for better nor for worse. As the moving
train hurries us onward we may enjoy successively the beauties of
canyon, prairie and lake, admiring each as we come to it without
prejudice to what has gone before. In <span class="pagenum"><a id=
"page176" name="page176"></a>[pg 176]</span>youth we love only
bright colors and their contrasts&mdash;brilliant sunsets and
autumn foliage; in later life we come to appreciate also the more
delicate tints and their gradations&mdash;a prospect of swamp-land
and distant lake or sea on a gray day; a smoky town in the fog; the
tender dove colors of early dawns. So in youth we eagerly read of
blood and glory and wild adventure; Trollope is insufferably dull.
Jane Austen is for old maids; even such a gem as Cranford we do not
rate at its true value. But in after life how their quiet shades
and tints come out! There is no glory in them, no carnage, no
combat; but there is charm and fascination in the very slowness of
their movement, the shortness of their range, their lack of
intensity, the absence of the shrill, high notes and the tremendous
bases.</p>
<p>Then there is the re-reading that accuses the reader of another
kind of change&mdash;a twist to the right or the left, a cast in
the mental eye, or perhaps the correction of such a cast. The
doctrines in some book seemed strange to you once&mdash;almost
abhorrent; you are ready to accept them now. Is it because you then
saw through a glass darkly and now more clearly? Or is your vision
darker now than it was? Your rereading apprizes you that there has
been a change of some sort. Perhaps you must await corroborative
testimony before you decide what its nature has been. Possibly you
read today without a blush what your mind of twenty years ago would
have been shocked to meet. Are you broader-minded or just hardened?
These questions are disquieting, but the disturbance that they
cause is wholesome, and I know of no way in which they can be
raised in more uncompromising form than by re-reading an old
favorite, by bringing the alterable fabric of your living, growing
and changing mind into contact with the stiff, unyielding
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page177" name="page177"></a>[pg
177]</span>yardstick of an unchangeable mental record&mdash;the
cast of one phase of a master mind that once was but has passed
on.</p>
<p>Here I can not help saying a word of a kind of re-reading that
is not the perusal of literature at all with most of us&mdash;the
re-reading of our own words, written down in previous
years&mdash;old letters, old lectures, articles&mdash;books,
perhaps, if we chance to be authors. Of little value, perhaps, to
others, these are of the greatest interest to ourselves because
instead of measuring our minds by an outside standard they enable
us to set side by side two phases of our own life&mdash;the ego of
1892, perhaps, and that of 1914. How boyish that other ego was; how
it jumped to conclusions; how ignorant it was and how
self-confident! And yet, how fresh it was; how quickly responsive
to new impressions; how unspoiled; how aspiring! If you want to
know the changes that have transformed the mind that was into the
very different one that now is, read your own old letters.</p>
<p>I have tried to show you that pure literature is an art and like
other arts depends primarily upon manner and only secondarily upon
matter. That the artist, who in this case is the author, uses his
power to influence the reader usually through his emotions or
feelings and that its effects to a notable extent, are not marred
by repetition. That on this account all good literature may be
re-read over and over, and that the pleasure derived from such
re-reading is a sign that a book is peculiarly adapted in some way
to the reader. Finally, that one&rsquo;s private library,
especially if its size be limited, may well consist of personal
favorites, often re-read.</p>
<p>When the astronomer Kepler had reduced to simple laws the
complicated motions of the planets he cried out in ecstacy:
&ldquo;O God! now think I Thy <span class="pagenum"><a id="page178"
name="page178"></a>[pg 178]</span>thoughts after Thee!&rdquo; Thus
when a great writer of old time has been vouchsafed a spark of the
divine fire we may think his divine thoughts after him by
re-reading. And Shakespeare tells us in that deathless speech of
Portia&rsquo;s, that since mercy is God&rsquo;s attribute we may by
exercising it become like God. Thus, by the mere act of tuning our
brains to think the thoughts that the Almighty has put into the
minds of the good and the great, may it not be that our own
thoughts may at the last come to be shaped in the same mould?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Old wine, old friends, old books,&rdquo; says the old
adage; and of the three the last are surely the most satisfying.
The old wine may turn to vinegar; old friends may forget or forsake
us; but the old book is ever the same. What would the old man do
without it? And to you who are young I would say&mdash;you may
re-read, you first must read. Choose worthy books to love. As for
those who know no book long enough either to love or despise
it&mdash;who skim through good and bad alike and forget page
ninety-nine while reading page 100, we may simply say to them, in
the words of the witty Frenchman, &ldquo;What a sad old age you are
preparing for yourself!&rdquo;</p>

<p>In one of his earlier books, Prof. Hugo Munsterberg cites the
growing love for tracing pedigrees as evidence of a dangerous
American tendency toward aristocracy. There are only two little
things the matter with this&mdash;the fact and the inference from
it. In the first place, we Americans have always been proud of our
ancestry and fond of tracing it; and in the second place, this
fondness is akin, not to aristocracy but to democracy. It is not
the purpose of this paper to prove this thesis in detail, so I will
merely bid you note that aristocratic pedigree-tracers confine
themselves to one line, or to a few lines. Burke will tell you that
one of the great-great-grandfathers of the present Lord Foozlem was
the First Baron; he is silent about his great-grandfather, the
tinker, and his great-grandfather, the pettifogging country lawyer.
Americans are far more apt to push their genealogical
investigations in all directions, because they are prompted by a
legitimate curiosity rather than by desire to prove a point,
American genealogical research is biological, while that of Europe
is commercial.</p>
<p>An obvious advantage of interest in our ancestors is that it
ought to make history a more vital thing to us; for to them,
history was merely current events in which they took part, or
which, at least, they watched. This linking up of our personal
ancestral lines with past events is done too seldom. Societies like
the New England Society are doing it, and it is <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page180" name="page180"></a>[pg 180]</span>for
this reason that I have chosen to bring the subject briefly before
you.</p>
<p>It has been noted that our historical notions of the Civil War
are now, and are going to be in the future, more just and less
partisan than those of the Revolution. This is not because we are
nearer the Civil War; for nearness often tends to confuse
historical ideas rather than to clear them up. It is because the
descendants of those who fought on both sides are here with us,
citizens of our common country, intermarrying and coming into
contact in a thousand ways. We are not likely to ignore the
Southern standpoint regarding the rights of secession and the
events of the struggle so long as the sons and daughters of
Confederate soldiers live among us. Nor shall we ever forget the
Northern point of view while the descendants of those who fought
with Grant and Sherman are our friends and neighbors.</p>
<p>It is otherwise with the Revolution. We are the descendants only
of those who fought on one side. Of the others, part went back to
their homes in England, the rest, our old neighbors and friends, we
despoiled of their lands and drove across our northern border with
execrations, to make new homes in a new land and view us with a
hatred that has not yet passed away. If you doubt it, discuss the
American Revolution for fifteen minutes with one of the United
Empire Loyalists of Toronto. It will surprise you to know that your
patriot ancestors were thieves, blacklegs and scoundrels. I do not
believe that they were; but possibly they were not the impossible
archangels of the school histories.</p>
<p>Of one thing I am sure; that if the descendants of those who
fought against us in &lsquo;76 had been left to mingle with our own
people, the historical recollections of the struggle would have
been surer and truer <span class="pagenum"><a id="page181" name=
"page181"></a>[pg 181]</span>on both sides than they are today.
Here is a case where ancestry has perverted history, but simply
because there has been an unnatural segregation of descendants. Let
me note another where we have absolutely forgotten our ancestral
predilections and have gone over to the other side, simply because
the other side made the records. When we read a Roman account of
encounters between the legions and the northern tribes, where do we
place ourselves in imagination, as readers? Always with the Roman
legions. But our place is not there; it is with our hardy and brave
forefathers, fighting to defend their country and their firesides
against the southern intruders. How many teachers of history try to
utilize race-consciousness in their pupils to make them attain a
clearer knowledge of what it all meant? Should we not be proud that
we are of the blood of men who withstood the self-styled rulers of
the world and won their freedom and their right to shape their own
personal and civic development?</p>
<p>I should like to see a book tracing the history and development
of an imaginary Anglo-Saxon American line of ancestry, taking it
from the forests of Northern Germany across to Britain, through the
Norman conquest and down the stream of subsequent English history
across seas to America&mdash;through savage wars and Revolution,
perhaps across the Alleghenies, to settle finally in the great
West. I would try to make the reader realize that here was no fairy
tale&mdash;no tale of countries and races with which we have naught
to do, but the story of our own fathers, whose features and whose
characteristics, physical and mental, have been transmitted by
heredity to us, their sons and daughters of the year 1913.</p>
<p>It is unfortunate perhaps, for our perceptions of racial
continuity, that we are rovers by disposition. <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page182" name="page182"></a>[pg 182]</span>Who
runs across the sea, says the Latin poet, changes his sky but not
his mind. True enough, but it is difficult for some of us to
realize it. It is hard for some of us to realize that our emigrant
ancestors were the same men and women when they set foot on these
shores as when they left the other side some weeks before. Our
trans-Atlantic cousins labor under the same difficulties, for they
assure us continually that we are a &ldquo;new&rdquo; country. We
have, they say, the faults and the advantages of
&ldquo;youth.&rdquo; It would be interesting to know at just what
point in the passage the education and the habits and the
prejudices of the incoming Englishman dropped off. Change of
environment works wonders with habits and even with character; we
must of course recognize that; but it certainly does not make of
the mind a <em>tabula rasa</em>, on which the fresh surroundings
may absolutely work their will.</p>
<p>I must say that our migrations within the limits of our own
continent have not been productive of so much forgetfulness. I have
been struck, for instance, since I came to St. Louis, with what I
may call the source-consciousness of our western population.
Everyone, whether he is particularly interested in genealogy or
not, knows that his people came from Vermont or Virginia or
Pennsylvania. He may not be able to trace his ancestry, or even to
name his great-grandfather; but with the source of that ancestry he
is always acquainted. I believe this to be the case throughout the
Middle West. From this point of view the population is not so well
mixed as it is in the East. No one in Massachusetts or Connecticut
can point out to you, offhand, the families that came from
particular counties in England. And yet in England, a migration
from one county to another is always recognized and remembered. A
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page183" name="page183"></a>[pg
183]</span>cousin of mine, visiting on an English estate, was
casually informed by his host, &ldquo;Our family are newcomers in
this county. We moved in only about 300 years ago.&rdquo; From this
point of view we are all newcomers in America. It is to be hoped
that as the years go on, the elements of our western population
will not so thoroughly lose sight of their sources as have the
Easterners. It is not likely that they will, for those sources are
more accessible. We have Virginia families who still keep up
friendly intercourse with the old stock; Vermont families who spend
each summer on the old homestead; and so on. The New Englander did
not and could not keep up similar relations with Old England. Even
the Southerner, who did it for a time, had to drop it. Our
inter-communication with Europe has grown enormously in volume, but
little of it, if any, is due to continuous ancestral interest,
although a revived general interest has sprung up and is to be
commended.</p>
<p>I fear, however, that the greater part of this interest in
sources, where it exists, is very far from an intelligent
connection with the body of historical fact. When a man is proud of
the fact that an ancestor took part in the famous Boston Tea Party,
has he taken any pains to ascertain what actually took place on
that occasion? If he claims descent from Pocahontas, can he tell us
just how much of what we currently believe of her is fact and how
much is myth? If he knows that his family came from Cheshire,
England, and was established and well-known there for centuries,
what does he know of the history of Cheshire and of the connection
of his ancestors with it? Our interest, when it exists, is
concentrated too much on trivial happenings. We know and boast that
an ancestor came over in the Mayflower without knowing of the
family doings before <span class="pagenum"><a id="page184" name=
"page184"></a>[pg 184]</span>and after that event. Of course,
connection with some one picturesque event serves to stimulate the
imagination and focus the interest, but these events should serve
as starting points for investigation rather than resting points
where interest begins and ends. Historical students are beginning
to realize that it is not enough to know about the battle of
Hastings without understanding the causes and forces that led to it
and proceeded from it, and the daily lives and thoughts of those
who took part in it, from captain to spearman.</p>
<p>This failure to link up family history with general history is
responsible for many sad losses of historical material. Many
persons do not understand the value of old letters and diaries;
many who do, keep them closely in the family archives where they
are unknown and unappreciated. Old letters containing material that
bears in any way on the events, customs or life of the time, should
be turned over to the local historical society. If they contain
private matter, seal up the packet and require that it shall remain
sealed for a century, if you wish; but do not burn it. The feeling
that destroys such documents is simply evidence that we are
historically valuing the individual and the family above the
community, just as we still are in so many other fields of thought.
I cannot tolerate the idea that we shall ultimately think only in
terms of the common good; the smaller units, the man, the family
must not lose their influence, but the connection between them and
the general welfare must be better understood and more generally
recognized; and this must be done, in the first place, in all that
relates to their historical records and to our historical
consciousness.</p>
<p>Ancestral feeling should, in this way, always be <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page185" name="page185"></a>[pg
185]</span>historical, not individual. A man is right to be
personally proud of his own achievements, but it is difficult to
see how he can properly take the same kind of pride in that of
others, whether related to him by blood or not. But there are other
kinds of legitimate pride&mdash;family pride, racial pride, group
pride of all sorts, where the feeling is not personal. If any
member of a family, a profession or any association, has so
conducted himself that credit is gained for the whole body, it is
proper that this kind of group pride should be felt by each member
of the body, and in the case of a family, where the bond is one of
blood, the group feeling should be stronger and the group pride, if
it is proper to feel it at all, may be of peculiar strength,
provided it be carefully distinguished from the pride due to
personal achievement. And when the member of the family in whom one
takes pride is an ancestor, this means, as I have said, that
feeling should be historical, not individual. And anything that
tends to lift our interest from the individual to the historical
plane&mdash;to make us cease from congratulating ourselves
personally on some connection with the good and great and
substitute a feeling of group pride shared in common by some body
to which we all belong, is acting toward this desirable end. The
body may be a family; it may be the community or the state; it may
be as broad as humanity itself, for we may all be proud of the
world&rsquo;s greatest. Or it may be a body like our own, formed to
cherish the memories of forebears in some particular line of
endeavor, in some particular place or at some particular era. Our
ancestry is part of our history; so long as our regard for it is
properly interwoven with our historical sense, no one can properly
charge us with laving the foundation for aristocracy. We are
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page186" name="page186"></a>[pg
186]</span>rather making true democracy possible, for such is the
case only when the elements of a community are closely united by
ties of blood, interest and knowledge&mdash;by pride in those who
have gone before and by determination that the standard set by
these men and women of old shall be worthily upheld.</p>

For</a><a id="footnotetag9" name="footnotetag9" href="#footnote9"

<p class="returnTOC"><a href="#Contents">Return to Table of
Contents</a></p>
<p>The most important things in the world are ideas. We are so
familiar with the things that are the material embodiment of
ideas&mdash;buildings, roads, vehicles and machines&mdash;that we
are prone to forget that without the ideas that gave them birth all
these would be impossible. A house is a mass of wood, stone and
metal, but all these substances, collected in a pile, do not
suffice to make a house.</p>
<p>A locomotive is made of steel and brass, but although the
ancient Romans had both the metal and the alloy, they had no
locomotives.</p>
<p>The vital thing about the house&mdash;the thing that
differentiates it from other masses of the same materials&mdash;is
the idea&mdash;the plan&mdash;that was in the architect&rsquo;s
mind while wood and stone and iron were still in forest, quarry and
mine. The vital thing about the locomotive is the builder&rsquo;s
idea or plan, which he derived, in turn, from the inventor.</p>
<p>The reason why there were no locomotives in ancient Rome is that
in those days the locomotive had not yet been invented, and when we
say this we refer not to the materials, which the Romans had in
abundance, but to the idea or plan of the locomotive. So it is with
the whole material world about us. The things that result, not from
man&rsquo;s activities, but from the operations of nature, are no
exceptions; for, if we are Christians, we believe that the idea or
plan of a man, or a horse, or a tree, was in the mind of the great
architect, the great machinist, before the world <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page188" name="page188"></a>[pg 188]</span>began,
and that this idea is the important thing about each.</p>
<p>A man, a house, an engine&mdash;these are ideas that lead to
things that we can feel, and see and hear. But there are other
ideas that have nothing of the kind to correspond to them&mdash;I
mean such ideas as charity, manliness, religion and
patriotism&mdash;what sometimes are called abstract qualities.
These are real things and their ideas are even more important than
the others, but we cannot see nor feel them.</p>
<p>Now, man likes to use his senses, and it is for this reason that
he is fond of using for these abstract ideas, symbols that he can
see and feel. We of St. Louis should appreciate this to the full
just now, for we have just set before the world the greatest
assemblage of symbolic images and acts, portraying our pride in the
past and our hope and confidence for the future, that any city on
this earth ever has been privileged to present or to witness.<a id=
"footnotetag10" name="footnotetag10" href="#footnote10" title=
"The Pageant and Masque of St. Louis, 1915."><sup>10</sup></a>
Whether we were actors or spectators; whether we camped with the
Indians, marched with De Soto or La Salle and felled the forests of
early St. Louis with Laclede and Chouteau, or whether we were part
of that great host on the hillside, we can say no longer that we do
not understand the importance of the idea, or the value and cogency
of the visible symbols that fix it in the memory and grip it to the
heart.</p>
<p>The Church of Christ always has understood and used this
property of the visible and tangible symbol to enforce the claims
of the abstract idea.</p>
<p>We revere the cross, not because there is anything in its shape
or substance to make us venerate it, but because it is the symbol
of the Christian religion&mdash;of all that it has done for the
world in the past and all that it may do in the future. That is why
we <span class="pagenum"><a id="page189" name="page189"></a>[pg
189]</span>love and honor the flag&mdash;not because it is a piece
of cloth bearing certain figures and colors, but because it is to
us the symbol of all that our country has meant to our fathers; all
it means to us and all that it may mean to our children, generation
after generation.</p>
<p>A nation&rsquo;s flag did not always mean all this to those who
gazed upon it. In very old times the flag was for the soldier alone
and had no more meaning for the ordinary citizen than a helmet or a
spear. When the soldier saw it uplifted in the thick of the battle
he rallied to it. Then the flag became the personal emblem of a
king or a prince, whether in battle or not; then it was used to
mark what belonged to the government of a country. It is still so
used in many parts of Europe, where the display of a flag on a
building marks it as government property, as our flag does when it
is used on a post office or a custom-house. Nowhere but in our own
country is the flag used as the general symbol of patriotic feeling
and displayed alike by soldier and citizen, by Government office
and private dwelling. So it comes about that the stars and stripes
means to us all that his eagles did to the Roman soldier; all that
the great Oriflamme did to the medieval Frenchman; all that the
Union Jack now means to the Briton or the tri-color to the
Frenchman&mdash;and more, very much more, beside.</p>
<p>What ideas, then, does the flag stand for? First, it stands for
union. It was conceived in union, it was dipped in blood to
preserve union, and for union it still stands. Its thirteen stripes
remind us of that gallant little strip of united colonies along the
Atlantic shore that threw down the gage of battle to Britain a
century and a half ago. Its stars are symbols of the wider union
that now is. Both may be <span class="pagenum"><a id="page190"
name="page190"></a>[pg 190]</span>held to signify the great truth
that in singleness of purpose among many there is effective
strength that no one by himself can hope to achieve. Our union of
States was formed in fear of foreign aggression; we have need of it
still though our foes be of our own household. If we are ever to
govern our cities properly, hold the balance evenly betwixt capital
and labor, develop our great natural resources without undue
generosity on the one hand or parsimony on the other&mdash;solve
the thousand and one problems that rise to confront us on every
hand&mdash;we shall never accomplish these things by struggling
singly&mdash;one man at a time or even one State at a time, but by
concerted, united effort, the perfect union of which our flag is a
symbol, and which we need to-day even more than we did in 1776 or
1861.</p>
<p>We stand on the threshold of an effort to alter our city
government. Whether that effort should or should not succeed, every
citizen must decide for himself, with the aid of such intelligence
and judgment as it has pleased God to give him. But if he should
decide in its favor, be certain that his individual vote at the
polls will go a very little way toward bringing his desires to
pass. We are governed by majorities, and a majority is a union of
many. He who would win must not only vote, but work. Our flag, with
its assemblages of stripes and stars, is a perpetual reminder that
by the union of the many, and not merely by the rectitude of the
individual, are policies altered and charters changed.</p>
<p>Again, our flag stands for love. It is a beautiful flag and it
stands for a beautiful land. We all love what is our own, if we are
normal men and women&mdash;our families, our city, our country.
They are all beautiful to us, and it is right that they should
be.</p>
<p>I confess that the movement that has for its <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page191" name="page191"></a>[pg 191]</span>motto
&ldquo;See America First&rdquo; has my hearty sympathy. Not that
the Rockies or the Sierras are necessarily more beautiful than the
Alps or the Missouri fairer than the Danube; we should have no more
to do here with comparisons than the man who loves his children. He
does not, before deciding that he will love them, compare them
critically with his neighbors&rsquo;. If we do not love the Grand
Canyon and the Northern Rockies, the wild Sierras and the more
peaceful beauties of the Alleghenies or the Adirondacks, simply
because leaving these all unseen we prefer the lakes and mountains
of foreign lands, we are like a man who should desert his own
children, whom he had never seen, to pass his time at a
moving-picture show, because he believed that he saw there faces
and forms more fair than those of his own little ones. When we sing
in our hymn of &ldquo;America&rdquo;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>I love thy rocks and rills</p>
<p>Thy woods and templed hills,</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class="noindent">we should be able to do it from the heart.</p>
<p>It is indeed fitting that we should love our country, and thrill
when we gaze at the old flag that symbolizes that love. Does this
mean that when our country makes an error we are to shut our eyes
to it? Does it require us to call wrong right and black white?</p>
<p>There is a sentiment with which you are all familiar, &ldquo;My
country, may she ever be right; but, right or wrong, my
country!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Understood aright, these are the noblest and truest of words,
but they are commonly misinterpreted, and they have done much harm.
To love and stand by a friend who has done wrong is a fine thing;
but it would be very different to abet him in his wrong-doing and
assure him that he had done right. We may dearly love a son or a
brother who is the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page192" name=
"page192"></a>[pg 192]</span>worst of sinners, without joining him
in sin or persuading him that he is righteous.</p>
<p>So we may say, &ldquo;Our country, right or wrong&rdquo; without
forfeiting the due exercise of our judgment in deciding whether she
is right or wrong, or the privilege of exerting our utmost power to
make her do right.</p>
<p>If she is fighting for an unrighteous cause, we should not go
over to the enemy, but we should do our best to make her cease and
to make amends for the wrong she has done.</p>
<p>Another thing for which the flag stands is freedom or liberty.
We all are familiar with the word. It means different things to
different persons. When hampering conditions press hard upon a man,
all that he thinks of for the moment is to be rid of them. Without
them he deems that he will be free. The freedom of which our
fathers thought, for which they fought and which they won, was
freedom from government by what had become to them a foreign power.
The freedom that the black man longed for in the sixties was
freedom from slavery.</p>
<p>To-day men and women living in intolerable industrial conditions
are panting for freedom&mdash;the freedom that seems to them just
now more desirable than aught else in the world. All this the flag
stands for, but it stands for much more. Under its folds we are
entitled to live our own lives in the fullest way compatible with
the exercise of the same privilege by others. This includes
political freedom, industrial freedom, social freedom and all the
rest. Despite much grumbling and some denials, I believe that it is
all summed up under political freedom, and that we have it all,
though we may not always take advantage of it. The people who groan
under an <span class="pagenum"><a id="page193" name=
"page193"></a>[pg 193]</span>industrial yoke do so because they do
not choose to exert the power given them by law, under the flag, to
throw it off. The boss-ridden city is boss-ridden only because it
is satisfied to be so. The generation that is throttled by trusts
and monopolies may at any time effect a peaceful revolution. The
flag gives us freedom, but even a man&rsquo;s eternal salvation
cannot be forced upon him against his will.</p>
<p>Another thing for which the flag stands is justice&mdash;the
&ldquo;square deal,&rdquo; as it is called by one of our
Presidents. To every man shall come sooner or later, under its
folds, that which he deserves. This means largely &ldquo;hands
off,&rdquo; and is but one of the aspects of freedom, or liberty,
since if we do not interfere with a man, what happens to him is a
consequence of what he is and what he does. If we oppress him, or
interfere with him, he gets less than he merits; and if, on the
contrary we coddle him and give him privileges, he may get more
than his due.</p>
<p>Give a man opportunity and a free path and he will achieve what
is before him in the measure of his strength. That the American
Flag stands for all this, thousands will testify who have left
their native shores to live under its folds and who have
contributed here to the world&rsquo;s progress what the restraints
and injustice of the old world forbade then to give.</p>
<p>This sense of the removal of bonds, of sudden release and the
entry into free space, is well put by a poet of our own, Henry Van
Dyke, when he sings,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>So it&rsquo;s home again, and home again, America for me!</p>
<p>My heart is turning home again, and there I long to be,</p>
<p>In the land of youth and freedom beyond the ocean bars,</p>
<p>Where the air is full of sunlight and the flag is full of
stars.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>I know that Europe&rsquo;s wonderful, yet something seems to
lack:</p>
<p>The Past is too much with her, and the people looking back,</p>
<p>But the glory of the Present is to make the Future
free&mdash;</p>
<p>We love our land for what she is and what she is to be.</p>
</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page194" name="page194"></a>[pg
194]</span>
<div class="stanza">
<p>Oh, it&rsquo;s home again, and home again, America for me!</p>
<p>I want a ship that&rsquo;s westward bound to plough the rolling
sea,</p>
<p>To the blessed Land of Room Enough beyond the ocean bars,</p>
<p>Where the air is full of sunlight and the flag is full of
stars.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Finally, the flag stands for the use of physical force where it
becomes necessary.</p>
<p>This simple statement of facts will grieve many good people, but
to omit it would be false to the truth and dishonorable to the flag
that we honor today.</p>
<p>Its origin, as we have seen, was in its service as a rallying
point in battle. We are still battling, and we still need it. And
at times our contests still inevitably take the physical form. One
may earnestly pray for peace; one may even pay his dues to the
Peace Society and still realize that to preserve peace we may have
to use the sword.</p>
<p>Northward, across the Canadian border, good men<a id=
"footnotetag11" name="footnotetag11" href="#footnote11" title=
"United States and 'A-B-C' Commissions on the State of Mexico."><sup>
11</sup></a> are striving even now to keep us in peace and to
assure peace to a neighbor severely torn by internal conflict. Can
any of us doubt that our good friend and fellow-citizen&mdash;nay,
can anyone doubt that our neighbors of the Southern
Continent&mdash;are doing their best to save human lives, to
preserve our young men and the young men of Mexico to build and
operate machines, to raise crops and to rebuild and beautify
cities, instead of sending them to fill soldiers&rsquo; graves, as
our bravest and best did in the &ldquo;sixties?&rdquo; And yet,
should they succeed, as God grant they may, who can doubt that what
will give strength and effect to their decisions will be the
possibility of force, exerted in a righteous cause, symbolized by
the flag? Who can be sorry that back of the flag there are earnest
men; nay, that there are ships there, and guns? One need not be a
Jingo; one can hate war <span class="pagenum"><a id="page195" name=
"page195"></a>[pg 195]</span>and love peace with all one&rsquo;s
heart and yet rejoice that the flag symbolizes authority&mdash;the
ability to back up a decision without which the mind itself cannot
decide in calmness and impartiality.</p>
<p>Surely, to say that the flag stands for the exertion of force,
is only to say that it stands for peace; for it is by force only,
or by the possibility of it, that peace is assured and
maintained.</p>
<p>These are a few of the many things for which our flag of the
Stars and Stripes stands. We are right to doff our hats when it
passes; we are right to love it and to reverence it, for in so
doing we are reverencing union, patriotism, liberty and justice.
That it shall never become an empty symbol; that it shall never
wave over a land disunited, animated by hate, shackled by
indifference and feebleness, permeated by injustice, unable to
exert that salutary strength which alone can preserve peace without
and within&mdash;this is for us to see and for our children and
grandchildren. We must not only exercise that &ldquo;eternal
vigilance&rdquo; of which the fathers spoke, but we must be
eternally ready, eternally active. The Star-Spangled Banner! Long
may it wave over a land whose sons and daughters are both free and
brave&mdash;free because they are brave, and brave because they are
free, and both because they are true children of that eternal
father without whom both freedom and bravery are but empty
names.</p>

<p>The change that has come over the library in the last half
century may be described, briefly but comprehensively, by saying
that it has become predominantly a social institution; that is,
that its primary concern is now with the service that it may render
to society&mdash;to the people. Books, of course, were always
intended to be read, and a library would have no meaning were it
never to be used; yet in the old libraries the collection and
preservation of the books was primary and their use secondary,
whereas the modern institution exists primarily for public service,
the collection of the books, their preservation, and whatever is
done to them being directed to this end. To a social
institution&mdash;a family, a school, a club, a church or a
municipality&mdash;the persons constituting it, maintaining it, or
served by it are all-important. A family without parents and
children, a school without pupils, a club without members, a church
with no congregation, a city without citizens&mdash;all are
unthinkable. We may better realize the change in our conception of
the public library by noting that it has taken its place among
bodies of this type. A modern library with no readers is
unthinkable; it is no library, as we now understand the word;
though it be teeming with books, housed in a palace, well cataloged
and properly manned.</p>
<p>It is no longer possible to question this view of the library as
a social institution&mdash;a means of rendering general service to
the widest public. We have <span class="pagenum"><a id="page198"
name="page198"></a>[pg 198]</span>to deal not with theories of what
the library ought to be, but, with facts indicating what it
actually is; and we have only to look about us to realize that the
facts give the fullest measure of support to what I have just said.
The library is a great distributing agency, the commodities in
which it deals being ideas and its customers the citizens at large,
who pay, through the agency of taxation, for what they receive.
This democratic and civic view of the public library&rsquo;s
functions, however, does not commend itself to those who are not in
sympathy with democratic ideals. In a recent address, a
representative librarian refers to it as &ldquo;the commercial
traveler theory&rdquo; of the library. The implication, of course,
is that it is an ignoble or unworthy theory. I have no objection to
accepting the phrase, for in my mind it has no such connotation.
The commercial traveler has done the world service which the
library should emulate rather than despise. He is the advance guard
of civilization. To speak but of our own country and of its recent
years, he is responsible for much of our improvement in transit
facilities and hotel accommodations. Personally, he is becoming
more and more acceptable. The best of our educated young men are
going into commerce, and in commerce to-day no one can reach the
top of the ladder who has not proved his efficiency &ldquo;on the
road.&rdquo; Would that we could place men of his type at the head
of all our libraries!</p>
<p>We need not think, however, that there is anything new in the
method of distribution by personal travel. Homer employed it when
he wished his heroic verse to reach the great body of his
countrymen. By personal travel he took it to the
cross-roads&mdash;just as the distributor of food and clothing and
labor-saving appliances does to-day; just as we librarians
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page199" name="page199"></a>[pg
199]</span>must do if we are to democratize all literature as Homer
democratized a small part of it. Homer, if you choose to say so,
adopted the &ldquo;commercial-traveler theory&rdquo; of literary
distribution; but I prefer to say that the modern public library,
in laying stress on the necessity of distributing its treasures and
in adopting the measures that have proved effective in other
fields, is working on the Homeric method.</p>
<p>Now, without the people to whom he distributed his wares, Homer
would have been dead long ago. He lives because he took his wares
to his audience. And without its public, as we have already said,
the public library, too, would soon pass into oblivion. It must
look to the public for the breath of life, for the very blood in
its veins, for its bone and sinew. What, then, is the part that the
community may play in increasing the efficiency of a public
institution like the public library? Such an institution is, first
of all, a medium through which the community does something for
itself. The community employs and supports it, and at the same time
is served by it. To use another homely illustration, which I am
sure will not please those who object to comparing great things
with small, this type of relationship is precisely what we find in
domestic service. A cook or a housemaid has a dual relation to the
mistress of the house, who is at the same time her employer and the
person that she directly serves. This sort of relation does not
obtain, for instance, in the case of a railroad employe, who is
responsible to one set of persons and serves another. The public
library is established and maintained by a given community in order
that it may perform certain service for that same community
directly. It seems to me that this dual relationship ought to make
for efficiency. If it does not, <span class="pagenum"><a id=
"page200" name="page200"></a>[pg 200]</span>it is because its
existence and significance are not always realized. The cook knows
that if she does not cook to suit her mistress she will lose her
job&mdash;the thing works almost automatically. If the railroad
employe does not serve the public satisfactorily there is no such
immediate reaction, although I do not deny that the public
displeasure may ultimately reach the railroad authorities and
through them the employe. In most public institutions the reaction
is necessarily somewhat indirect. The post office is a public
institution, but public opinion must act on it generally through
the channels of Congressional legislation, which takes time. Owing
to this fact, very few postmen, for instance, realize that the
persons to whom they deliver letters are also their employers. In
all libraries the machinery of reaction is not the same. In St.
Louis, for instance, the library receives the proceeds of a tax
voted directly by the people; in New York City it receives an
appropriation voted by the Board of Apportionment, whose members
are elected by the people. The St. Louis Public Library is
therefore one step nearer the control of the people than the New
York Public Library. If we could imagine the management of either
library to become so objectionable as to make its abolition
desirable, a petition for a special election could remove public
support in St. Louis very soon. In New York the matter might have
to become an issue in a general election, at which members of a
Board of Apportionment should be elected under pledge to vote
against the library&rsquo;s appropriation. Nevertheless, in both
cases there is ultimate popular control. Owing to this dual
relation, the public can promote the efficiency of the library in
two ways&mdash;by controlling it properly and by its attitude
toward the service that is rendered. Every member of the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page201" name="page201"></a>[pg
201]</span>public, in fact, is related to the library somewhat as a
railway stockholder, riding on a train, is related to the company.
He is at once boss and beneficiary. Let us see first what the
public can do for its library through its relation of control.
Besides the purse-strings, which we have seen are sometimes held
directly by the public and sometimes by its elected
representatives, we must consider the governing board of the
institution&mdash;its trustees or directors. These may be elected
by the people or appointed by an elected officer, such as the
mayor, or chosen by an elected body, such as the city council or
the board of education.</p>
<p>Let us take the purse-strings first. Does your public library
get enough public money to enable it to do the work that it ought
to do? What is the general impression about this in the community?
What does the library board think? What does the librarian think?
What do the members of his staff say? What has the library&rsquo;s
annual report to say about it? It is not at all a difficult matter
for the citizen to get information on this subject and to form his
own opinion regarding it. Yet it is an unusual thing to find a
citizen who has either the information or a well-considered
opinion. The general impression always seems to be that the library
has plenty of money&mdash;rather more, in fact, than it can
legitimately use. It is probably well for the library, under these
circumstances, that the public control of its purse-strings is
indirect. If the citizens of an average American city had to go to
the polls annually and vote their public library an appropriation,
I am sure that most libraries would have to face a very material
reduction of their income.</p>
<p>The trouble about this impression is that it is gained without
knowledge of the facts. If a majority <span class="pagenum"><a id=
"page202" name="page202"></a>[pg 202]</span>of the citizens,
understanding how much work a modern public library is expected to
do and how their own library does it, should deliberately conclude
that its management was extravagant, and that its expenditure
should be cut down, the minority would have nothing to do, as good
citizens, but submit. The citizens have nothing to say as directly
as this, but the idea, so generally held, that libraries are well
off, does operate in the long run to limit library appropriations
and to prevent the library from doing much useful work that it
might do and ought to do.</p>
<p>It is then, every citizen&rsquo;s business, as I conceive it, to
inform himself or herself of the work that the public library is
doing, of that which it is leaving undone, and of the possibilities
of increased appropriations. If the result is a realization that
the library appropriation is inadequate, that realization should
take the form of a statement that will sooner or later reach the
ears, and tend to stimulate the action, of those directly
responsible. And it should, above all, aid in the formation of a
sound public opinion. Ours is, we are told, a government of public
opinion. Such government will necessarily be good or bad as public
opinion is based on matured judgment or only on fleeting
impressions.</p>
<p>Inadequacy of support is responsible for more library
delinquency than the average citizen imagines. Many a librarian is
deservedly condemned for the unsatisfactory condition of his
institution when his fault is not, as his detractors think, failure
to see what should be done, or lack of ability to do it, so much as
inability to raise funds to do it with. This is doubtless a fault,
and its possessor should suffer, but how about the equally guilty
accessories? How about the city authorities who have failed to vote
the library adequate support? How about the board of <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page203" name="page203"></a>[pg
203]</span>trustees who have accepted such a situation without
protest? And what is more to our purpose here, how about the
citizens who have limited their efforts to pointing out the cracks
in the edifice, with not a bit of constructive work in propping it
up and making possible its restoration to strength and
soundness?</p>
<p>In conversation with a friend, not long ago, I referred to the
financial limitations of our library&rsquo;s work, and said that we
could add to it greatly and render more acceptable service if our
income were larger. He expressed great surprise, and said:
&ldquo;Why, I thought you had all the money you want; your income
must be all of $100,000 a year.&rdquo; Now, our income actually is
about $250,000, but how could I tell him that? I judiciously
changed the subject.</p>
<p>Let us look next, if you please, at the library board and
examine some of its functions. There appears to be much public
misapprehension of the duties of this body, and such
misapprehension assumes various and opposing forms. Some appear to
think that the librarian is responsible for all that is done in the
library and that his board is a perfunctory body. Others seem to
believe that the board is the direct administrative head of the
library, in all of its working details and that the librarian is
its executive in the limited sense of doing only those things that
he is told to do. Unfortunately there are libraries that are
operated in each of these ways, but neither one relationship nor
the other, nor any modification of either, is the ideal one between
a librarian and his board. The board is supreme, of course, but it
is a body of non-experts who have employed an expert to bring about
certain results. They ought to know what they want, and what they
have a right to expect, and if their expert does not give them
this, the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page204" name=
"page204"></a>[pg 204]</span>relation between him and them should
terminate; but if they are men of sense they will not attempt to
dictate methods or supervise details. They are the delegated
representatives of the great public, which owns the library and
operates it for a definite purpose. It is this function of the
board as the representative of the public that should be emphasized
here. Has the public a definite idea of what it wants from the
public library, and of what is reasonable for it to ask? If so, is
it satisfied that it is represented by a board that is of the same
mind? The citizens may be assured that the composition of the
library board rests ultimately upon its will. If the board is
elective, this is obvious; if appointive, the appointing officer or
body would hardly dare to go counter to the expressed desire of the
citizens.</p>
<p>What has been said above may be put into a very few words. The
public library is public property, owned and controlled by the
citizens. Every citizen, therefore, should be interested in setting
standards for it and playing his part toward making it conform to
them&mdash;in seeing that its governing body represents him in also
recognizing those standards and trying to maintain them&mdash;in
laboring for such a due apportionment of the public funds as shall
not make an attempt to live up to such standards a mere farce.</p>
<p>So much for the things that the citizen can and should do in his
capacity of library boss. His possibilities as a beneficiary are
still more interesting and valuable.</p>
<p>Perhaps you remember the story of the man who attempted to board
the warship and, on being asked his business, replied,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m one of the owners.&rdquo; One version of the tale
then goes on to relate how the sailor thus addressed picked up a
splinter from the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page205" name=
"page205"></a>[pg 205]</span>deck, and, handing it to the visitor,
remarked: &ldquo;Well, I guess that&rsquo;s about your share. Take
it and get out!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I have always sympathized with the sailor rather than with his
visitor. Most of us librarians have had experiences with these
bumptious &ldquo;owners&rdquo; of public property. The fact has
already been noted that in a case like this the citizen is both an
owner and a beneficiary. He has duties and privileges in both
capacities, but he sometimes acts the owner in the wrong place. The
man on the warship was doubtless an owner, but at that particular
moment he was only a visitor, subject to whatever rules might
govern visitors; and he should have acted as such. Every citizen is
a part owner of the public library; he should never forget that
fact. We have seen how he may effectively assert his ownership and
control. But when he enters the library to use it his role is that
of beneficiary, and he should act as such. He may so act and at the
same time be of the greatest service to the institution which he,
as a member of the public, has created and is maintaining.</p>
<p>I know of no way in which a man may show his good citizenship or
the reverse&mdash;may either demonstrate his ability and
willingness to live and work in community harness, or show that he
is fit for nothing but individual wild life in the
woods&mdash;better than in his use of such a public institution as
a library. The man who cannot see that what he gets from such an
institution must necessarily be obtained at the price of
sacrifice&mdash;that others in the community are also entitled to
their share, and that sharing always means yielding&mdash;that man
has not yet learned the first lesson in the elements of civic
virtue. And when one sees a thousand citizens, each of whom would
surely raise his voice in protest if the library were <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page206" name="page206"></a>[pg 206]</span>to
waste public money by buying a thousand copies of the latest novel,
yet find fault with the library because each cannot borrow it
before all the others, one is tempted to wonder whether we really
have here a thousand bad citizens or whether their early education
in elementary arithmetic has been neglected.</p>
<p>Before the present era there were regulations in all
institutions that seemed to be framed merely to exasperate&mdash;to
put the public in its place and chasten its spirit. There are now
no such rules in good libraries. He who thinks there are may find
that there is a difference of opinion between him and those whom he
has set in charge of the library regarding what is arbitrary and
what is necessary; but at any rate he will discover that the
animating spirit of modern library authority is to give all an
equal share in what it has to offer, and to restrain one man no
more than is necessary to insure to his brother the measure of
privilege to which all are equally entitled.</p>
<p>Another way in which the citizen, in his capacity of the
library&rsquo;s beneficiary, can aid it and improve its service is
his treatment of its administrators. Librarians are very human:
they react quickly and surely to praise or blame, deserved or
undeserved. Blame is what they chiefly get. Sometimes they deserve
it and sometimes not. But the occasions on which some citizen steps
in and says, &ldquo;Well done, good and faithful servant,&rdquo;
are rare indeed. The public servant has to interpret silence as
praise; so sure is he that the least slip will be caught and
condemned by a vigilant public. No one can object to discriminating
criticism; it is a potent aid to good administration. Mere petulant
fault-finding, however, especially if based on ignorance or
misapprehension, does positive harm. And a little discriminating
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page207" name="page207"></a>[pg
207]</span>praise, now and then, is a wonderful stimulant. No
service is possible without the men and women who render it; and
the quality of service depends, more than we often realize, on the
spirit and temper of a staff&mdash;something that is powerfully
affected, either for good or for evil, by public action and public
response.</p>
<p>Years ago, at a branch library in a distant city, a reader stood
at the counter and complained loudly because the library would not
send her a postal reserve notice unless she defrayed the cost,
which was one cent. The assistant to whom she was talking had no
option in the matter and was merely enforcing a rule common, so far
as I know, to all American public libraries; but she had to bear
the brunt of the reader&rsquo;s displeasure, which she did meekly,
as it was all in the day&rsquo;s work. The time occupied in this
useless business spelled delay to half a dozen other readers, who
were waiting their turn. Finally, one of them, a quiet little old
lady in black, spoke up as follows: &ldquo;Some of us hereabouts
think that we owe a great debt of gratitude to this library. Its
assistants have rendered service to us that we can never repay. I
am glad to have an opportunity to do something in return, and it
therefore gives me pleasure to pay the cent about which you are
taking up this young lady&rsquo;s time, and ours.&rdquo; So saying,
she laid the coin on the desk and the line moved on. I have always
remembered these two points of view as typical of two kinds of
library users. Their respective effects on the temper and work of a
library staff need, I am sure, no explanation.</p>
<p>In what I have said, which is such a small fraction of what
might be said, that I am almost ashamed to offer it to you, I have
in truth only been playing the variations on one tune, which
is&mdash;Draw closer <span class="pagenum"><a id="page208" name=
"page208"></a>[pg 208]</span>to the library, as it is trying to
draw closer to you. There is no such thing, physicists tell us, as
a one-sided force. Every force is but one aspect of a stress, which
includes also an equal and opposing force. Any two interacting
things in this world are either approaching each other or receding
from each other. So it should be with library and public. A forward
movement on the one hand should necessarily involve one to meet
it.</p>
<p>The peculiarity of our modern temper is our hunger for
facts&mdash;our confidence that when the facts are known we shall
find a way to deal with them, and that until the facts are known we
shall not be able to act&mdash;not even to think. Our ancestors
thought and acted sometimes on premises that seem to us frightfully
flimsy&mdash;they tried, as Dean Swift painted them in his immortal
satire, to get sunbeams from cucumbers. There are some
sunbeam-chasers among us to-day, but even they recognize the need
of real cucumbers to start with; the imaginary kind will not do. I
recently heard a great teacher of medicine say that the task of the
modern physician is merely to ascertain the facts on which the
intelligent public is to act. How different that sounds from the
dicta of the medicine of a past generation! It is the same
everywhere: we are demanding an accurate survey&mdash;an
ascertainment of the facts in any field in which action, based on
inference and judgment, is seen to be necessary. Now the library is
nothing more nor less than a storehouse of recorded facts. It is
becoming so more truly and more fully every day, thereby adjusting
itself to the modern temper of which I have already spoken. The
library and its users are coming more closely together, in
sympathy, in aims and in action, than ever before&mdash;partly a
result and partly a justification for that <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page209" name="page209"></a>[pg 209]</span>Homeric
method of popularizing it which has been characterized and
condemned as commercial. The day when the librarian, or the
professor, or the clergyman could retire into his tower and hold
aloof from the vulgar herd is past. The logical result of such an
attitude is now being worked out on the continent of Europe. Not
civilizations, as some pessimists are lamenting, but the forces
antagonistic to civilization are there destroying one another, and
there is hope that a purified democracy will arise from the
wreckage. May our American civilization never have to run the
gantlet of such a terrible trial! Meanwhile, there can be no doubt
that the hope for the future efficiency of all our public
institutions, including the library, lies in the success of
democracy, and that depends on the existence and improvement of the
conditions in whose absence democracy necessarily fails. Foremost
among these is the homogeneity of the population. The people among
whom democracy succeeds must have similar standards, ideas, aims
and abilities. Democracy may exist in a pack of wolves, but not in
a group that is half wolves and half men. Either the wolves will
kill the men or the men the wolves. This is an extreme case, but it
is true in general that in a community made up of irreconcilable
elements there can be no true democracy. And the same oneness of
vision and purpose that conduces to the success of democracy will
also bring to perfection such great democratic institutions as the
library, which have already borne such noteworthy fruit among us
just because we are homogeneous beyond all other nations on the
earth. And here progress is by action and reaction, as we see it so
often in the world. The unity of aims and abilities that makes
democracy and democratic institutions possible is itself
facilitated and increased by the work of <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page210" name="page210"></a>[pg 210]</span>those
institutions. The more work the library does, the more its
ramifications multiply, and the further they extend, the more those
conditions are favored that make the continuance of the library
possible. In working for others, it is working for itself, and
every additional bit of strength and sanity that it takes on does
but enable it to work for others the more. And if the democracy
whose servant it is will but realize that it has grown up as a part
of that American system to which we are all committed&mdash;to
which we owe all that we are and in which we must place all our
hopes for the future&mdash;then neither democracy nor library will
have aught to fear. Democracy will have its &ldquo;true and
laudable&rdquo; service from the library, and the library in its
turn will have adequate sympathy, aid and support from the
people.</p>
<p>It is no accident that I make this appeal for sympathy and aid
to a club composed of women. The bonds between the modern public
library and the modern woman&rsquo;s club have been particularly
strong in this country. The two institutions have grown up
together, making their way against suspicion, contempt and
hostility, aided by the same public demand, and now, when both are
recognized as elements in the intellectual strength of our nation,
they are rendering mutual service. The club turns to the library
daily. Hitherto the library has turned to the club only in some
emergency&mdash;a bill to be passed, an appropriation to be made,
an administration to be purified. I have tried to show you how,
apart from these great services, which no one would think of
minimizing, the women of this country, as citizens, can uphold the
hands of the library daily. Ours is a government of public opinion,
and in the formation of that opinion there is no more powerful
element <span class="pagenum"><a id="page211" name=
"page211"></a>[pg 211]</span>than the sentiment of our women,
especially when organized in such bodies as yours.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To be aristocratic in taste and democratic in
service,&rdquo; says Bliss Perry, &ldquo;is the privilege and glory
of the public library.&rdquo; In appealing thus to both your
aristocracy and your democracy, I feel, then, that I have not gone
astray.</p>

<p>The modern American mind, like modern America, itself, is a
melting pot. We are taking men and women of all races and fusing
them into Americans. In the same way we are taking points of view,
ideas, standards and modes of action from whatever source we find
them, combining them and fusing them into what will one day become
American thoughts and standards. We are thus combining the most
varied and opposing things&mdash;things that it would seem
impossible to put together. Take our modern American tendency in
government, for instance. Could there be two things more radically
different than despotism and democracy?&mdash;the rule of the one
and the rule of the many? And yet I believe that we are taking
steps toward a very successful combination of the two. Such a
combination is essentially ancient. No despotism can hold its own
without the consent of the governed. That consent may be unwilling
and sooner or later it is then withheld, with the result that a
revolution takes place and the despot loses his throne&mdash;the
oldest form of the recall. Every despotism is thus tempered by
revolution, and Anglo-Saxon communities have been ready to exercise
such a privilege on the slightest sign that a despotic tendency was
creeping into their government.</p>
<p>It is not remarkable, then, that our own Federal government,
which is essentially a copy of the British government of its day,
should have incorporated this <span class="pagenum"><a id="page214"
name="page214"></a>[pg 214]</span>feature of the recall, which in
England had just passed from its revolutionary to its legal stage.
It was beginning to be recognized then that a vote of the
people&rsquo;s representatives could recall a monarch, and the
English monarchy is now essentially elective. But to make assurance
doubly sure, the British government, in its later evolution, has
been practically separated from the monarch&rsquo;s person, and any
government may be simply overthrown or &ldquo;recalled&rdquo; by a
vote of lack of confidence in the House of Commons, followed, if
need be, by a defeat in a general election. We have not yet adopted
this feature. Our President is still the head of our government,
and he and all other elected Federal officers serve their terms
out, no matter whether the people have confidence in them or not.
But the makers of our Constitution improved on the British
government as they found it. They made the term of the executive
four years instead of life and systematized the
&ldquo;recall&rdquo; by providing for impeachment
proceedings&mdash;a plan already recognized in Britain in the case
of certain administrative and judicial officers.</p>
<p>As it stands at present we have a temporary elective monarch
with more power, even nominally, than most European constitutional
monarchs and more actually than many so-called absolute monarchs
such as the Czar or the Sultan. In case he should abuse the power
that we have given him, he may be removed from office after due
trial, by our elected representatives.</p>
<p>In following out these ideas in later years, we are gradually
evolving a form of government that is both more despotic and more
democratic. We are combining the legislative and executive power in
the hands of a few persons, hampering them very little in their
exercise of it, and making it possible to recall them <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page215" name="page215"></a>[pg 215]</span>by
direct vote of the body of citizens that elected them. I think we
may describe the tendency of public thought in governmental matters
as a tendency toward a despotism under legalized democratic
control. It may be claimed, I think, that the best features of
despotism and democracy may thus be utilized, with a minimum of the
evils of each.</p>
<p>It was believed by the ancients, and we frequently see it stated
today, that the ideal government would he government by a perfectly
good despot. This takes the citizens into account only as persons
who are governed, and not as persons who govern or help to govern.
It is pleasant, perhaps, to have plenty of servants to wait upon
one, but surely health, physical, mental and moral, waits on him
who does most things for himself. I once heard Lincoln Steffens
say: &ldquo;What we want is not &lsquo;Good Government&rsquo;; it
is <em>Self</em>-Government.&rdquo; But is it not possible to get
the advantage of government by a few, with its possibilities of
continuous policy and its freedom from
&ldquo;crowd-psychology,&rdquo; with its skillful utilization of
expert knowledge, while admitting the public to full knowledge of
what is going on, and full ultimate control of it? We evidently
think so, and our present tendencies are evidence that we are
attempting something of the kind. Our belief seems to be that if we
elect our despot and are able to recall him we shall have to keep
tab on him pretty closely, and that the knowledge of statecraft
that will thus be necessary to us will be no less than if we
personally took part in legislation and
administration&mdash;probably far more than if we simply went
through the form of delegating our responsibilities and then took
no further thought, as most of us have been accustomed to do.</p>
<p>Whether this is the right view or not&mdash;whether it is
workable&mdash;the future will show; I am here discussing
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page216" name="page216"></a>[pg
216]</span>tendencies, not their ultimate outcome. But it would be
too much to expect that this or any other eclectic policy should be
pleasing to all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The real problem of collectivism,&rdquo; says Walter
Lippmann, &ldquo;is the difficulty of combining popular control
with administrative power&hellip;. The conflict between democracy
and centralized authority &hellip; is the line upon which the
problems of collectivism will be fought out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In selecting elements from both despotism and democracy we are
displeasing the adherents of both. There is too much despotism in
the plan for one side and too much democracy for the other. We
constantly hear the complaint that concentrated responsibility with
popular control is too despotic, and at the same time the criticism
that it is too democratic. To put your city in the hands of a small
commission, perhaps of a city manager, seems to some to be a return
to monarchy; and so perhaps it is. To give Tom, Dick and Harry the
power to unseat these monarchs at will is said to be dangerously
socialistic; and possibly it is. Only it is possible that by
combining these two poisons&mdash;this acid and this
alkali&mdash;in the same pill, we are neutralizing their harmful
qualities. At any rate this would seem to be the idea on which we
are now proceeding.</p>
<p>We may now examine the effects of this tendency toward
eclecticism in quite a different field&mdash;that of morals. Among
the settlers of our country were both Puritans and
Cavaliers&mdash;representatives in England of two moral standards
that have contended there for centuries and still exist there side
by side. We in America are attempting to mix them with some measure
of success. This was detected by the German lady of whom Mr. Bryce
tells in his &ldquo;American Commonwealth,&rdquo; who said that
American women were <span class="pagenum"><a id="page217" name=
"page217"></a>[pg 217]</span>&rdquo;<em>furchtbar frei und
furchtbar fromm</em>&ldquo;&mdash;frightfully free and frightfully
pious! In other words they are trying to mix the Cavalier and
Puritan standards. Of course those who do not understand what is
going on think that we are either too free or too pious. We are
neither; we are trying to give and accept freedom in cases where
freedom works for moral efficiency and restraint where restraint is
indicated. We have not arrived at a final standard. We may not do
so. This effort at mixture, like all our others, may fail; but
there appears to be no doubt that we are making it. To take an
obvious instance, I believe that we are trying, with some success,
to combine ease of divorce with a greater real regard for the
sanctity of marriage. We have found that if marriage is made
absolutely indissoluble, there will be greater excuse for
disregarding the marriage vow than if there are legal ways of
dissolving it.</p>
<p>Americans are shocked at Europeans when they allude in ordinary
conversation to infractions of the moral code that they treat as
trivial. They on the other hand are shocked when we talk of divorce
for what they consider insufficient causes. In the former case we
seem to them &ldquo;frightfully pious&rdquo;; in the latter,
&ldquo;frightfully free.&rdquo; They are right; we are both; it is
only another instance of our tendency towards eclecticism, this
time in moral standards.</p>
<p>In some directions we find that this tendency to eclecticism is
working toward a combination not of two opposite things, but of a
hundred different ones. Take our art for instance, especially as
manifested in our architecture. A purely native town in Italy,
Arabia, or Africa, or Mexico, has its own atmosphere; no one could
mistake one for the other any more than he could mistake a beaver
dam for an ant hill or a bird&rsquo;s nest for a woodchuck
hole.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page218" name="page218"></a>[pg
218]</span>But in an American city, especially where we have enough
money to let our architects do their utmost, we find streets where
France, England, Italy, Spain, Holland, Arabia and India all stand
elbow to elbow, and the European visitor knows not whether to laugh
or to make a hasty visit to his nerve-specialist. It seems all
right to us, and it <em>is</em> all right from the standpoint of a
nation that is yet in the throes of eclecticism. And our other
art&mdash;painting, sculpture, music&mdash;it is all similarly
mixed. Good of its kind, often; but we have not yet settled down to
the kind that we like best&mdash;the kind in which we are best
fitted to do something that will live through the ages.</p>
<p>We used to think for instance that in music the ordinary
diatonic major scale, with its variant minor, was a fact of nature.
We knew vaguely that the ancient Greeks had other scales, and we
knew also that the Chinese and the Arabs had scales so different
that their music was generally displeasing to us. But we explained
this by saying that our scale was natural and right and that the
others were antiquated, barbaric and wrong. Now we are opening our
arms to the exotic scales and devising a few of our own. We have
the tonal and the semi-tonal scales and we are trying to make use
of the Chinese, Arabic and Hindu modes. We are producing results
that sound very odd to ears that are attuned to the old-fashioned
music, but our eclecticism here as elsewhere is cracking the shell
of prejudice and will doubtless lead to some good end, though
perhaps we can not see it yet.</p>
<p>How about education? In the first place there are, as I read the
history of education, two main methods of training youth&mdash;the
individual method and the class method. No two boys or girls are
alike; no two have like reactions to the same stimulus.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page219" name="page219"></a>[pg
219]</span>Each ought to have a separate teacher, for the methods
to be employed must be adapted especially to the material on which
we have to work. This means a separate tutor for every child.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the training that we give must be
social&mdash;must prepare for life with and among one&rsquo;s
fellow beings, otherwise it is worthless. This means training in
class, with and among other students, where each mind responds not
to the teacher&rsquo;s alone but to those of its fellow pupils.</p>
<p>Here are two irreconcilable requirements. In our modern systems
of education we are trying to respond to them as best we may,
teaching in class and at the same time giving each pupil as much
personal attention as we can. The tutorial system, now employed in
Princeton University, is an interesting example of our efforts as
applied to the higher education.</p>
<p>At the same time, eclecticism in our choice of subjects is very
manifest, and at times our success here seems as doubtful as our
mixture of architectural styles. In the old college days, not so
very long ago, Latin, Greek, and mathematics made up the
curriculum. Now our boys choose from a thousand subjects grouped in
a hundred courses. In our common schools we have introduced so many
new subjects as to crowd the curriculum. Signs of a reaction are
evident. I am alluding to the matter here only as another example
of our modern passion for wide selection and for the combination of
things that apparently defy amalgamation.</p>
<p>What of religion? Prof. George E. Woodberry, in his interesting
book on North Africa, says in substance that there are only two
kinds of religion, the simple and the complex. Mohammedanism he
considers a simple religion, like New England Puritanism, with
which he thinks it has points in common. <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page220" name="page220"></a>[pg 220]</span>Both
are very different from Buddhism, for instance. Accepting for the
moment his classification I believe that the facts show an effort
to combine the two types in the United States. Many of the
Christian denominations that Woodberry would class as
&ldquo;simple&rdquo;&mdash;those that began with a total absence of
ritual, are becoming ritualized. Creeds once simple are becoming
complicated with interpretation and comment. On the other hand we
may see in the Roman Catholic Church and among the so-called
&ldquo;High Church&rdquo; Episcopalians a disposition to adopt some
of the methods that have hitherto distinguished other religious
bodies. Consider, for example, some of the religious meetings held
by the Paulist Fathers in New York, characterized by popular
addresses and the singing of simple hymns. As another example of
the eclectic spirit of churches in America we may point to the
various efforts at combination or unity, with such results as the
Federation of the Churches of Christ in America&mdash;an ambitious
name, not yet justified by the facts&mdash;the proposed
amalgamation of several of the most powerful Protestant bodies in
Canada, and the accomplished fact of the University of
Toronto&mdash;an institution whose constituent colleges are
controlled by different religious denominations, including the
Roman Catholic Church. I may also mention the present organization
of the New York Public Library, many of whose branch libraries were
contributions from religious denominations, including the Jews, the
Catholics and the Episcopalians. All these now work together
harmoniously. I know of nothing of this kind on any other
continent, and I think we shall be justified in crediting it to the
present American tendency to eclecticism.</p>
<p>Turn for a moment to philosophy. What is the philosophical
system most widely known at present <span class="pagenum"><a id=
"page221" name="page221"></a>[pg 221]</span>as American? Doubtless
the pragmatism of William James. No one ever agreed with anyone
else in a statement regarding philosophy, and I do not expect you
to agree with me in this; but pragmatism seems to me essentially an
eclectic system. It is based on the character of results. Is
something true or false? I will tell you when I find out whether it
works practically or not. Is something right or wrong? I rely on
the same test. Now it seems to me that this is the scheme of the
peasant in later Rome, who was perfectly willing to appeal to Roman
Juno or Egyptian Isis or Phoenician Moloch, so long as he got what
he wanted. If a little bit of Schopenhauer works, and some of
Fichte; a piece of Christianity and a part of Vedantism, it is all
grist to the mill of pragmatism. Any of it that works must of
necessity be right and true. I am not criticizing this, or trying
to controvert it; I am merely asserting that it leads to
eclecticism; and this, I believe, explains its vogue in the United
States.</p>
<p>It would be impossible to give, in the compass of a brief
address, a list of all the domains in which this
eclecticism&mdash;this tendency to select, combine and
blend&mdash;has cropped out among us Americans of today. I have
reserved for the last that in which we are particularly
interested&mdash;the Public Library, in which we may see it
exemplified in an eminent degree. The public library in America has
blossomed out into a different thing, a wider thing, a combination
of more different kinds of things, than in any other part of the
world. Foreign librarians and foreign library users look at us
askance. They wonder at the things we are trying to combine under
the activities of one public institution; they shudder at our
extravagance. They wonder that our tax-payers do not rebel when
they are compelled to foot the bills for what we do. But the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page222" name="page222"></a>[pg
222]</span>taxpayers do not seem to mind. They frequently complain,
but not about what we are doing. What bothers them is that we do
not try to do more. When we began timidly to add branch libraries
to our system they asked us why we did not build and equip them
faster; when we placed a few books on open shelves they demanded
that we treat our whole stock in the same way; when we set aside a
corner for the children they forced us to fit up a whole room and
to place such a room in every building, large or small. We have
responded to every such demand. Each response has cost money and
the public has paid the bill. Apparently librarians and public are
equally satisfied. We should not be astonished, for this merely
shows that the library is subject to the same laws and tendencies
as all other things American.</p>
<p>Hence it comes about that whereas in a large library a century
ago there were simply stored books with no appliances to do
anything but keep them safe, we now find in library buildings all
sorts of devices to facilitate the quick and efficient use of the
books both in the building and in the readers&rsquo; homes,
together with other devices to stimulate a desire to use books
among those who have not yet felt it; to train children to use and
love books; to interest the public in things that will lead to the
use of books. This means that many of the things in a modern
library seem to an old-fashioned librarian and an old-fashioned
reader like unwarranted extensions or even usurpations. In our own
Central building you will find collections of postal cards and
specimens of textile fabrics, an index to current lectures,
exhibitions and concerts, a public writing-room, with free
note-paper and envelopes, a class of young women studying to be
librarians, meeting places for all sorts of clubs and groups,
civic, educational, social, political and religious; <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page223" name="page223"></a>[pg 223]</span>a
bindery in full operation, a photographic copying-machine;
lunch-rooms and rest-rooms for the staff; a garage, with an
automobile in it, a telephone switchboard, a paintshop, a
carpenter-shop, and a power-plant of considerable capacity. Not one
of these things I believe, would you have found in a large library
fifty years ago. And yet the citizens of St. Louis seem to be
cheerful and are not worrying over the future. We are eclectic, but
we are choosing the elements of our blend with some discretion and
we have been able, so far, to relate them all to books, to the
mental activities that are stimulated by books and that produce
more books, to the training that instils into the rising generation
a love for books. The book is still at the foundation of the
library, even if its walls have received some architectural
embellishment of a different type.</p>
<p>When anyone objects to the introduction into the library of what
the colleges call &ldquo;extra-curriculum activities,&rdquo; I
prefer to explain and justify it in this larger way, rather than to
take up each activity by itself and discuss its
reasonableness&mdash;though this also may be undertaken with the
hope of success. In developing as it has done, the Library in the
United States of America has not been simply obeying some law of
its own being; it has been following the whole stream of American
development. You can call it a drift if you like; but the Library
has not been simply drifting. The swimmer in a rapid stream may
give up all effort and submit to be borne along by the current, or
he may try to get somewhere. In so doing, he may battle with the
current and achieve nothing but fatigue, or he may use the force of
the stream, as far as he may, to reach his own goal. I like to
think that this is what many American institutions are doing, our
libraries among them. They <span class="pagenum"><a id="page224"
name="page224"></a>[pg 224]</span>are using the present tendency to
eclecticism in an effort toward wider public service. When, in a
community, there seems to be a need for doing some particular
thing, the library, if it has the equipment and the means, is doing
that thing without inquiring too closely whether there is logical
justification for linking it with the library&rsquo;s activities
rather than with some others. Note, now, how this desirable result
is aided by our prevailing American tendency toward eclecticism.
Suppose precisely the same conditions to obtain in England, or
France, or Italy, the admitted need for some activity, the ability
of the library and the inability of any other institution, to
undertake it. I submit that the library would be extremely unlikely
to move in the matter, simply from the lack of the tendency that we
are discussing. That tendency gives a flexibility, almost a
fluidity, which under a pressure of this kind, yields and ensures
an outlet for desirable energy along a line of least
resistance.</p>
<p>The Englishman and the American, when they are arguing a case of
this kind, assume each the condition of affairs that obtains in his
own land&mdash;the rigidity on the one hand, the fluidity on the
other. They assume it without stating it or even thoroughly
understanding it, and the result is that neither can understand the
conclusions of the other. The fact is that they are both right. I
seriously question whether it would be right or proper for a
library in a British community to do many of the things that
libraries are doing in American communities. I may go further and
say that the rigidity of British social life would make it
impossible for the library to achieve these things. But it is also
true that the fluidity of American social life makes it equally
impossible for the library to withstand the pressure that is
brought to <span class="pagenum"><a id="page225" name=
"page225"></a>[pg 225]</span>bear on it here. To yield is in its
case right and proper and a failure of response would be wrong and
improper.</p>
<p>It is usually assumed by the British critic of American
libraries that their peculiarities are due to the temperament of
the American librarian. We make a similar assumption when we
discuss British libraries. I do not deny that the librarians on
both sides have had something to do with it, but the determining
factor has been the social and temperamental differences between
the two peoples. Americans are fluid, experimental, eclectic, and
this finds expression in the character of their institutions and in
the way these are administered and used.</p>
<p>Take if you please the reaction of the library on the two sides
of the water to the inevitable result of opening it to
home-circulation&mdash;the necessity of knowing whether a given
book is or is not on the shelves. The American response was to open
the shelves, the British, to create an additional piece of
machinery&mdash;the indicator. These two results might have been
predicted in advance by one familiar with the temper of the two
peoples. It has shown itself in scores of instances, in the front
yards of residences, for instance&mdash;walled off in England and
open to the street in the United States.</p>
<p>I shall be reminded, I suppose, that there are plenty of open
shelves in English libraries and that the open shelf is gaining in
favor. True; England is becoming &ldquo;Americanized&rdquo; in more
respects than this one. But I am speaking of the immediate reaction
to the stimulus of popular demand, and this was as I have stated
it. In each case the reaction, temporarily at least, satisfied the
demand; showing that the difference was not of administrative habit
alone, but of community feeling.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page226" name="page226"></a>[pg
226]</span>This rapid review of modern American tendencies, however
confusing the impression that it may give, will at any rate
convince us, I think, of one thing&mdash;the absurdity of objecting
to anything whatever on the ground that it is un-American. We are
the most receptive people in the world. We &ldquo;take our good
things where we find them,&rdquo; and what we take becomes
&ldquo;American&rdquo; as soon as it gets into our hands. And yet,
if anything new does not happen to suit any of us, the favorite
method of attack is to denounce it as &ldquo;un-American.&rdquo;
Pretty nearly every element of our present social fabric has been
thus denounced, at one time or another, and as it goes on changing,
every change is similarly attacked.</p>
<p>The makers of our Constitution were good conservative
Americans&mdash;much too conservative, some of our modern radicals
say&mdash;yet they provided for altering that Constitution, and set
absolutely no limits on the alterations that might be made,
provided that they were made in the manner specified in the
instrument. We can make over our government into a monarchy
tomorrow, if we want, or decree that no one in Chicago shall wear a
silk hat on New Year&rsquo;s Day. It was recently the fashion to
complain that the amendment of the Constitution has become so
difficult as to be now practically a dead letter. And yet we have
done so radical a thing as to change absolutely the method of
electing senators of the United States; and we did it as easily and
quietly as buying a hat&mdash;vastly more easily than changing a
cook. The only obstacle to changing our Constitution, no matter how
radically and fundamentally, is the opposition of the people
themselves. As soon as they want the change, it comes quickly and
simply. Changes like these are not un-American if the American
people like them well enough to make them. They, and they
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page227" name="page227"></a>[pg
227]</span>alone, are the judges of what peculiarities they shall
adopt as their own customs and characteristics. So that when we
hear that this or that is un-American, we may agree only in so far
as it is not yet an American characteristic. That we do not care
for it today is no sign that we may not take up with it tomorrow,
and it is no legitimate argument against our doing so, if we think
proper.</p>
<p>And now what does this all mean? The pessimist will tell us,
doubtless, that it is a sign of decadence. It does remind us a
little of the later days of the Roman empire when the peoples of
the remotest parts of the known world, with their arts, customs and
manners, were all to be found in the imperial city&mdash;when the
gods of Greece, Syria and Egypt were worshipped side by side with
those of old Rome, where all sorts of exotic art, philosophy,
literature and politics took root and flourished. That is usually
regarded as a period of decadence, and it was certainly a precursor
of the empire&rsquo;s fall. When we consider that it was
contemporaneous with great material prosperity and with the spread
of luxury and a certain loosening of the moral fiber, such as we
are experiencing in America today, we can not help feeling a little
perturbed. Yet there is another way of looking at it. A period of
this sort is often only a period of readjustment. The Roman empire
as a political entity went out of existence long ago, but
Rome&rsquo;s influence on our art, law, literature and government
is still powerful. Her so-called &ldquo;fall&rdquo; was really not
a fall but a changing into something else. In fact, if we take
Bergson&rsquo;s view-point&mdash;which it seems to me is
undoubtedly the true one, the thing we call Rome was never anything
else but a process of change. At the time of which we speak the
visible part of the change was accelerated&mdash;that is all. In
like manner each one of you as an individual <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page228" name="page228"></a>[pg 228]</span>is not
a fixed entity. You are changing every instant and the reality
about you is the change, not what you see with the eye or
photograph with the camera&mdash;that is merely a stage through
which you pass and in which you do not stay&mdash;not for the
thousand millionth part of the smallest recognizable instant. So
our current American life and thought is not something that stands
still long enough for us to describe it. Even as we write the
description it has changed to another phase. And the phenomena of
transition just now are particularly noticeable&mdash;that is all.
We may call them decadent or we may look upon them as the
beginnings of a new and more glorious national life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The size and intricacy which we have to deal with,&rdquo;
says Walter Lippmann, &ldquo;have done more than anything else, I
imagine, to wreck the simple generalizations of our
ancestors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This is quite true, and so, in place of simplicity we are
introducing complexity, very largely by selection and combination
of simple elements evolved in former times to fit earlier
conditions. Whether organic relations can be established among
these elements, so that there shall one day issue from the welter
something well-rounded, something American, fitting American
conditions and leading American aspirations forward and upward, is
yet on the knees of the gods. We, the men and women of America, and
may I not say, we, the Librarians of America, can do much to direct
the issue.</p>

<p>The graduation of a class of technically trained persons is an
event of special moment. When we send forth graduates from our
schools and colleges devoted to general education, while the
thought of failure may be disquieting or embarrassing, we know that
no special danger can result, except to the man who has failed. The
college graduate who has neglected his opportunities has thrown
away a chance, but he is no menace to his fellows. Affairs take on
a different complexion in the technical or professional school. The
poorly trained engineer, physician or lawyer, is an injury to the
community. Failure to train an engineer may involve the future
failure of a structure, with the loss of many lives. Failure to
train a doctor means that we turn loose on the public one who will
kill oftener than he will cure. Failure to train a lawyer means
wills that can be broken, contracts that will not hold, needless
litigation.</p>
<p>Congressman Kent, of California, has coined a satisfactory word
for this sort of thing&mdash;he calls it
&ldquo;mal-employment.&rdquo; Unemployment is a bad thing. We have
seen plenty of it here during the past winter. But Kent says, and
he is right, that malemployment is a worse thing. All these poor
engineers and doctors and lawyers are busily engaged, and every
thing on the surface seems to be going on well. But as a matter of
fact, the world would be better off if each one of them should stop
working and never do another stroke. It would pay the community to
support them in idleness.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page230" name="page230"></a>[pg
230]</span>I have always considered pharmacy to be one of the
occupations in which malemployment is particularly objectionable.
If you read Homer badly it affects no one but yourself. If you
think Vera Cruz is in Italy and that the Amazon River runs into the
Arctic Ocean, your neighbor is as well off as before; but if you
are under the impression that strychnine is aspirin, you have
failed in a way that is more than personal.</p>
<p>I am dwelling on these unpleasant possibilities partly for the
reason that the Egyptians displayed a skeleton at their
banquets&mdash;because warnings are a tonic to the soul&mdash;but
also because, if we are to credit much that we see in general
literature, including especially the daily paper and the popular
magazine, <em>all</em> druggists are malemployed. And if it would
really be better for the community that you should not enter upon
the profession for which you have been trained, now, of course, is
the time for you to know it.</p>
<p>There seems to be a widespread impression&mdash;an
assumption&mdash;that the day of the drug is over&mdash;that the
therapeutic of the future are to be concerned along with hygiene
and sanitation, with physical exercise, diet, and mechanical
operations. The very word &ldquo;drug&rdquo; has come to have an
objectionable connection that did not belong to it fifty years ago.
Even some of the druggists themselves, it seems to me, are a little
ashamed of the drug part of their occupation. Their places of
business appear to be news-agencies, refreshment parlors,
stationery stores&mdash;the drugs are &ldquo;on the side,&rdquo; or
rather in the rear. Sometimes, I am told, the proprietors of these
places know nothing at all about pharmacy, but employ a
prescription clerk who is a capable pharmacist. Here the druggist
has stepped down from his former position as the manager
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page231" name="page231"></a>[pg
231]</span>of a business and has become a servant. All of which
looks to me as if the pharmacist himself might be beginning to
accept the valuation that some people are putting upon his services
to the community.</p>
<p>Now these things affect me, not as a physician nor as a
pharmacist, for I am neither, but they do touch me as a student of
physics and chemistry and as one whose business and pleasure it has
been for many years to watch the development of these and other
sciences. The fact that I am addressing you this evening may be
taken, I suppose, as evidence that you may be interested in this
point of view. The action of most substances on the human organism
is a function of their chemical constitution. Has that chemical
constitution changed? It is one of the most astonishing discoveries
of our age that many, perhaps all, substances undergo spontaneous
disintegration, giving rise to the phenomena now well known as
&ldquo;radio-activity.&rdquo; No substances ordinarily known and
used in pharmacy, however, possess this quality in measurable
degree, and we have no reason to suppose that the alkaloids, for
instance, or the salts of potash or iron, differ today in any
respect from those of a century ago. How about the other factor in
the reaction&mdash;the human organism and its properties? That our
bodily properties have changed in the past admits of no doubt. We
have developed up to the point where we are at present. Here,
however, evolution seems to have left us, and it is now devoting
its attention exclusively to our mental and moral progress. Judging
from what is now going on upon the continent of Europe, much
remains to be accomplished. But there is no reason to believe that
if Caesar or Hannibal had taken a dose of opium, or ipecac, or
aspirin, the effect would have been different from that experienced
today by one of you. This is <span class="pagenum"><a id="page232"
name="page232"></a>[pg 232]</span>what a physicist or a chemist
would expect. If the action of a drug on the organism is chemical,
and if neither the drug nor the organism has changed, the action
must be the same. If we still desire to bring about the action and
if there is no better way to do it, we must use the drug, and there
is still need for the druggist. As a matter of fact, the number of
drugs at your disposal today is vastly greater than ever before,
largely owing to the labor, and the ingenuity, of the analytical
chemist. And there are still great classes of compounds of whose
existence the chemist is assured, but which he has not even had
time to form, much less to investigate. Among these may lurk
remedies more valuable than any at our disposal today. It does not
look, at any rate, as if the druggist were going to be driven out
of business from lack of stock, whether we regard quantity or
variety. To what, then, must we attribute the growth of the feeling
that the treatment of disease by the administration of drugs is on
the decline? From the standpoint of a layman it seems to be due to
two facts, or at least to have been strongly affected by them: (1)
The discovery and rapid development of other therapeutic measures,
such as those dependent on surgical methods, or on the use of
immunizing serums, or on manipulations such as massage, or on diet,
or even on mental suggestion; and (2) the very increase in the
number and variety of available drugs alluded to above, which has
introduced to the public many new and only partially tried
substances, the results of whose use has often been unexpectedly
injurious, including a considerable number of new habit-forming
drugs whose ravages are becoming known to the public.</p>
<p>The development of therapeutic measures that are independent of
drugs has been coincident with popular <span class="pagenum"><a id=
"page233" name="page233"></a>[pg 233]</span>emancipation from the
mere superstition of drug-administration. The older lists of
approved remedies were loaded with items that had no curative
properties at all, except by suggestion. They were purely
magical&mdash;the thumb-nails of executed criminals, the hair of
black cats, the ashes of burned toads and so on. Even at this
moment your pharmacopoeia contains scores of remedies that are
without effect or that do not produce the effects credited to them.
I am relying on high therapeutical authority for this statement.
Now when the sick man is told by his own physician to discard
angleworm poultices, and herbs plucked in the dark of the moon, on
which he had formerly relied, it is any wonder that he has ended by
being suspicious also of calomel and ipecac, with which they were
formerly classed? And when the man who believed that he received
benefit from some of these magical remedies is told that the result
was due to auto-suggestion, is it remarkable that he should fall an
easy prey next day to the Christian Scientist who tells him that
the effects of calomel and ipecac are due to nothing else than this
same suggestion? The increased use and undoubted value of special
diets, serums, aseptic surgery, baths, massage, electrical
treatment, radio-therapeutics, and so on, makes it easy for him to
discard drugs altogether, and further, it creates, even among those
who continue to use drugs, an atmosphere favorable to the belief
that they are back numbers, on the road to disuse. Just here comes
in the second factor to persuade the layman, from what has come
under his own observation, that drugs are injurious, dangerous,
even fatal. Newly discovered chemical compounds with valuable
properties, have been adopted and used in medicine before the
necessary time had elapsed to disclose the fact that they possessed
also other properties, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page234" name=
"page234"></a>[pg 234]</span>more elusive than the first, but as
potent for harm as these were for good. Many were narcotics or
valuable anesthetics, local or otherwise, which have proved to be
the creators of habits more terrible than the age-long enemies of
mankind, alcohol and opium. When the man whose wife takes a
coal-tar derivative for headache finds that it stills her heart
forever, the incident affects his whole opinion of drugs. When the
patient for whom one of the new drugs has been prescribed by a
practitioner without knowledge of his idiosyncrasies reacts to it
fatally, it is slight consolation to his survivors that his case is
described in print under the heading, &ldquo;A Curious Case of
Umptiol Poisoning.&rdquo; When a mother sees her son go to the bad
by taking cocaine, or heroin, or some other drug of whose existence
she was ignorant a dozen years ago, she may be pardoned for
believing that all drugs, or at least all newly discovered drugs,
are tools of the devil.</p>
<p>And this feeling is intensified by one of our national
faults&mdash;the tendency to jump at conclusions, to overdo things,
to run from one evil to its opposite, without stopping at the
harmless mean. We think we are brighter and quicker than the
Englishman or the German. They think we are more superficial.
Whatever name you give the quality it causes us to &ldquo;catch
on&rdquo; sooner, to work a good thing to death more thoroughly and
to drop it more quickly for something else, than any other known
people, ancient or modern. Somebody devises a new form of skate
roller that makes roller-skating a good sport. We find it out
before anyone else and in a few months the land is plastered from
Maine to California with huge skating halls or sheds. Everybody is
skating at once and the roar of the rollers resounds across the
oceans. We skate ourselves out in a year or two, and then the roar
ceases, the sheds decay and roller-skating is once <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page235" name="page235"></a>[pg 235]</span>more a
normal amusement. Then someone invents the safety bicycle, and in a
trice all America, man, woman and child, is awheel. And we run this
good horse to death, and throw his body aside in our haste to
discover something new. Shortly afterward someone invents a new
dance, or imports it from Spanish America, and there is hardly time
to snap one&rsquo;s finger before we are all dancing, grandparents
and children, the cook in the kitchen and the street-cleaner on the
boulevard.</p>
<p>We display as little moderation in our therapeutics. We can not
get over the idea that a remedy of proved value in a particular
case may be good for all others. Our proprietary medicines will
cure everything from tuberculosis to cancer. If massage has
relieved rheumatism, why should it not be good also for typhoid?
The Tumtum Springs did my uncle&rsquo;s gout so much good; why
doesn&rsquo;t your cousin try them for her headaches? And even so,
drugs must be all good or bad. Many of us remember the old
household remedies, tonics or laxatives or what not, with which the
children were all dosed at intervals, whether they were ill or not.
That was in the days when all drugs were good: when one &ldquo;took
something&rdquo; internally for everything that happened to him.
Now the pendulum has swung to the other side&mdash;that is all. If
we can ever settle down to the rational way of regarding these
things, we shall discover, what sensible medical men have always
known, and what druggists as well as mere laymen can not afford to
neglect, that there is no such thing as a panacea, and that all
rational therapeutics is based on common sense study of the
disease&mdash;finding out what is the cause and endeavoring to
abate that cause. The cause may be such that surgery is indicated,
or serum, or regulation of diet, or change of scene. It may
obviously <span class="pagenum"><a id="page236" name=
"page236"></a>[pg 236]</span>indicate the administration of a drug.
I once heard a clever lawyer in a poisoning case, in an endeavor to
discredit a physician, whom we shall call Dr. Jones, tell the
following anecdote: (Dr. Jones, who had been called in when the
victim was about to expire, had recommended the application of
ice). Said the lawyer:</p>
<p>&ldquo;A workman was tamping a charge of blasting-powder with a
crowbar, when the charge went off prematurely and the bar was
driven through the unfortunate man&rsquo;s body, so that part of it
protruded on either side: A local physician was summoned, and after
some study he pronounced as follows: &lsquo;Now, if I let that bar
stay there, you&rsquo;ll die. If I pull it out, you&rsquo;ll die.
But I&rsquo;ll give you a pill that may melt it where it is!&rsquo;
In this emergency,&rdquo; the lawyer went on to say, &ldquo;Dr.
Jones doubtless would have prescribed <em>ice</em>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now the pill to melt the crowbar may stand for our former
excessive and absurd regard for drugs. The application of ice in
the same emergency may likewise represent a universal resort to
hydrotherapy. Neither of them is logical. There is place for each,
but there are emergencies that can not be met with either. Still,
to abandon one method of treatment simply because additional
methods have proved to be valuable, would be as absurd as to give
up talking upon the invention of writing or to prohibit the raising
of corn on land that will produce wheat.</p>
<p>No: we shall doubtless continue to use drugs and we shall
continue to need the druggist. What can he do to make his business
more valued and respected, more useful to the public and more
profitable to himself? For there can be no doubt that he will
finally succeed in attaining all these desirable results together,
or fail in all. Here and there we may find a <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page237" name="page237"></a>[pg 237]</span>man who
is making a fortune out of public credulity and ignorance, or, on
the other hand, one who is giving the public more service than it
pays for and ruining himself in the process; but in general and on
the average personal and public interest run pretty well hand in
hand. Henry Ford makes his millions because he is producing
something that the people want. St. Jacob&rsquo;s Oil, once the
most widely advertised nostrum on the continent, cost its promoters
a fortune because there was nothing in it that one might not find
in some other oil or grease.</p>
<p>What then, I repeat, must the pharmacist do to succeed,
personally and professionally? I welcome this opportunity to tell
you what I think. My advice comes from the outside&mdash;often the
most valuable source. I have so little to do with pharmacy, either
as a profession or as a business that I stand far enough away to
get a bird&rsquo;s-eye view. And if you think that any advice,
based on this view, is worthless, it will be a consolation to all
of us to realize that no force on earth can compel you to take
it.</p>
<p>It is doubtless too late to lament or try to resist the course
of business that has gone far to turn the pharmacy into a
department store. But let me urge you not to let this tendency run
wild. There are side-lines that belong properly to pharmacy, such
as all those pertaining to hygiene or sanitation; to the toilet, to
bodily refreshment. I do not see why one should not expect to find
at his pharmacist&rsquo;s, soap, or tooth-brushes, or sponges. I do
not see why the thirsty man should not go there for mineral water
as well as the dyspeptic for pills. But I fail to see the
connection between pharmacy and magazines, or stationery or candy.
By selling these the druggist puts himself at once into competition
with the department stores. There can be no doubt about who will
win out <span class="pagenum"><a id="page238" name=
"page238"></a>[pg 238]</span>in any such competition as that. But I
believe there is still a place in the community for any special
line of business if its proprietor sticks to his specialty and
makes himself a recognized expert in it. The department store
spreads itself too thin&mdash;there is no room for intensive
development at any point of its vast expanse. Its general success
is due to this very fact. I am not now speaking of the rural
community where there is room only for one general store selling
everything that the community needs. But my statement holds good
for the city and the large town.</p>
<p>Let me illustrate by an instance in which we librarians are
professionally interested&mdash;the book store. Once every town had
its book-store. Now they are rare. We have few such stores even in
a city of the size of St. Louis. Every department store has its
book-section. They are rarely satisfactory. Everybody is lamenting
the disappearance of the old book-store, with its old scholarly
proprietor who knew books and the book-market; who loved books and
the book-business. Quarts of ink have been wasted in trying to
account for his disappearance. The Public Library, for one thing,
has been blamed for it. I have no time now to disprove this, though
it is very clear to me that libraries help the book trade instead
of hindering it. I shall simply give you my version of the trouble.
The book-dealer disappeared, as soon as he entered into competition
with the department store. He put in side lines of toys, and art
supplies, and cameras and candy. He began to spread himself thin
and had no time for expert concentration on his one specialty. Thus
he lost his one advantage over the department store&mdash;his
strength in the region where it was weak; and of course he
succumbed. If you will think for a moment of the special businesses
that have survived the competition of the department <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page239" name="page239"></a>[pg 239]</span>store,
you will see that they are precisely the ones that have resisted
this temptation to spread themselves and have been content to
remain experts. Look at the men&rsquo;s furnishing stores. Would
they have survived if they had begun to sell cigars and
lawn-mowers? Look at the retail shoe stores, the opticians, the
cigar stores, the bakers, the meat markets, the confectioners, the
restaurants of all grades! They have all to compete with the
department stores, but their customers realize that they have
something to offer that can be offered by no department
store&mdash;expert service in one line, due to some one&rsquo;s
life-long training, experience and devotion to the public.</p>
<p>I do not want the pharmacist to go the way of the book dealers.
Already some of the department stores include drug departments. I
do not see how these can be as good as independent pharmacies. But
I do not see the essential difference between a drug department in
a store that sells also cigars and stationery and confectionery,
and a so-called independent pharmacy that also distributes these
very things.</p>
<p>I am assuming that the druggist is an expert. That is the object
of our colleges of pharmacy, as I understand the matter. As a
librarian I want to deal with a book man who knows more of the book
business than I do. I want to ask his advice and be able to rely on
it. When I have printing to be done, I like to give it to a man who
knows more about the printed page than I do. When I buy bread, or
shoes, or a house, or a farm I like to deal with recognized experts
in these articles. How much more when I am purchasing substances
where expert knowledge will turn the balance between life and
death. I have gossiped with pharmacists enough to know that all
physicians do not avoid incompatibles in their prescriptions, and
that occasionally a combination falls into <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page240" name="page240"></a>[pg 240]</span>the
prescription clerk&rsquo;s hands, which, if made up as he reads it
would produce a poisonous compound, or perhaps even an explosive
mixture. Two heads are better than one, and if my physician ever
makes a mistake of this kind I look to my pharmacist to see that it
shall not reach the practical stage.</p>
<p>I recognize the great value and service of the department store,
but I do not go there for my law or medicine; neither do I care to
resort thither for my pharmacy. I want our separate drug stores to
persist, and I want them to remain in charge of experts.</p>
<p>And when the store deals in other things than purely therapeutic
preparations&mdash;which I have already said I think probably
unavoidable,&mdash;I want it to present the aspect of a pharmacy
that deals also in toilet preparations and mineral water, not of an
establishment for dispensing soda-water and soap, where one may
have a prescription filled on the side, in an emergency. And when
the emergency does arise, I should have the pharmacy respond to it.
It is the place where we naturally look in an emergency&mdash;the
spot to which the victim of an accident is carried
directly&mdash;the one where the lady bends her steps when she
feels that she is going to faint. In hundreds of cases the drug
store is our only standby, and it should be the druggist&rsquo;s
business to see that it never fails us. There are pharmacies where
a telephone message brings an unfailing response; there are others
to which one would as soon think of sending an inquiry regarding a
Biblical quotation. To which type, do you think, will the public
prefer to resort?</p>
<p>Then there are those little courtesies that no retail business
is obliged to offer, but that the public has been accustomed to
expect from the druggist&mdash;the cashing of checks, the changing
of bills, the furnishing of postage stamps, the consultation of the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page241" name="page241"></a>[pg
241]</span>city directory. There can be no reason for resorting to
a drug store for all these favors except that the pharmacist has an
enviable reputation as the man who is most likely to grant them.
And yet I begin to hear druggists complaining of the results of
this reputation, of which they ought to be proud; I see them
pointing out that there is no profit on postage stamps and no
commission for changing a bill. They intimate, further, that
although it may be proper for them to put themselves out for
regular customers, it is absurd for strangers to ask for these
courtesies. I marvel when I hear these sentiments. If this popular
impression regarding the courtesy of the druggist did not exist, it
would be worth the expenditure of vast sums and the labor of a
lifetime to create it. To deliberately undo it would be as foolish
as to lock the door in the face of customers.</p>
<p>I do not believe that in St. Louis the pharmaceutical profession
is generally averse to a reputation for generous public service,
and I base my belief on some degree of personal knowledge. The St.
Louis Public Library operates about sixty delivery stations in
various parts of the city. These stations are all in drug stores.
The work connected with them, though light, is by no means
inconsiderable, and yet not one of the druggists who undertake it
charges the library a cent for his space or his services. Doubtless
they expect a return from the increased attractiveness of their
places to the public. I hope that they get it and I believe that
they do. At any rate we have evidence here of the
pharmacist&rsquo;s belief that the bread of public service, cast
upon the waters, will sooner or later return.</p>
<p>You will notice that I am saying nothing about advertising. One
would think from the pharmaceutical papers, with which I am not
unfamiliar, that the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page242" name=
"page242"></a>[pg 242]</span>druggist&rsquo;s chief end was to have
a sensational show window of some kind. These things are not
unimportant, but I do not dwell on them because I believe that if a
druggist realizes the importance of his profession; if he makes
himself a recognized expert in it; if he sticks to it and magnifies
it; if he makes his place indispensable to the community around
him, the first point to which the citizens resort for help in an
emergency, an unfailing center of courtesy and favor&mdash;he may
fill his window with toilet soap, or monkeys, or with nothing at
all&mdash;there will still be a trodden path up to his door.</p>
<p>Gentlemen, you have chosen as your life work a profession that I
believe to be indispensable to human welfare&mdash;one of enviable
tradition and honor and with standing and reputation in the
community that set it apart, in some degree from all others. And
while I would not have you neglect the material success that it may
bring you, I would urge you to expect this as a result rather than
strive for it as an immediate end. I would have you labor to
maintain and develop the special knowledge that you have gained in
this institution, to hold up the standard of courtesy and
helpfulness under which you can best do public service, confident
that if you do these things, business standing and financial
success will also be added unto you.</p>

<p>In endeavoring to distinguish between self-education and
education by others, one meets with considerable difficulty. If a
boy reads Mill&rsquo;s &ldquo;Political Economy&rsquo;&rdquo; he is
surely educating himself; but if after reading each chapter he
visits a class and answers certain questions propounded for the
purpose of ascertaining whether he has read it at all, or has read
it understandingly, then we are accustomed to transfer the credit
for the educative process to the questioner, and say that the boy
has been educated at school or college. As a matter of fact, I
think most of us are self-educated. Not only is most of what an
adult knows and can do, acquired outside of school, but in most of
what he learned even there he was self-taught. His so-called
teachers assigned tasks to him and saw that he performed them. If
he did not, they subjected him to discipline. Once or twice in a
lifetime most of us have run up against a real teacher&mdash;a man
or a woman that really played a major part in shaping our minds as
they now are&mdash;our stock of knowledge, our ways of thought, our
methods of doing things. These men have stood and are still
standing (though they may have joined the great majority long ago)
athwart the stream of sensation as it passes through us, and are
determining what part shall be stored up, and where; what kind of
action shall ultimately result from it. The influence of a good
teacher spreads farther and lasts longer than that of any other
man. If his words have been recorded in books it may reach across
the seas and down the ages.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page244" name="page244"></a>[pg
244]</span>There is another reason why the distinction between
school education and self-education breaks down. If the boy with
whom we began had any teacher at all it was John Stuart Mill, and
this man was his teacher whether or not his reading of the book was
prescribed and tested in a class-room. I would not have you think
that I would abolish schools and colleges. I wish we had more of
the right kind, but the chief factor in educative acquirement will
still be the pupil.</p>
<p>So when the community educates itself, as it doubtless does and
as it must do, it simply continues a process with which it has
always been familiar, but without control, or under its own
control. Of all the things that we learn, control is the most
vital. What we are is the sum of those things that we do not
repress. We begin without self-repression and have to be controlled
by others. When we learn to exercise control ourselves, it is right
that even our education should revert wholly to what it has long
been in greater part&mdash;a voluntary process.</p>
<p>This does not mean that at this time the pupil abandons
guidance. It means that he is free to choose his own guides and the
place and method of using them. Some rely wholly on experience;
others are wise enough to see that life is too short and too narrow
to acquire all that we need, and they set about to make use also of
that acquired by others. Some of these wiser ones use only their
companions and acquaintances; others read books. The wisest are
opportunists; they make use of all these methods as they have
occasion. Their reading does not make them avoid the exchange of
ideas by conversation, nor does the acquirement of ideas in either
way preclude learning daily by experience, or make reflection
useless or unnecessary.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page245" name="page245"></a>[pg
245]</span>He who lives a full life acquires ideas as he may,
causes them to combine, change and generate in his own mind, and
then translates them into action of some kind. He who omits any of
these things cannot be said to have really lived. He cannot, it is
true, fail to acquire ideas unless he is an idiot; but he may fail
to acquire them broadly, and may even make the mistake of thinking
that he can create them in his own mind.</p>
<p>He may, however, acquire fully and then merely store without
change or combination; that is, he may turn his brain into a
warehouse instead of using it as a factory.</p>
<p>And the man who has acquired broadly and worked over his raw
material into a product of his own, may still stop there and never
do anything. Our whole organism is subsidiary to action and he who
stops short of it has surely failed to live.</p>
<p>Our educative processes, so far, have dwelt heavily on
acquirement, somewhat lightly on mental assimilation and digestion,
and have left action almost untouched. In these two latter
respects, especially, is the community self-educated.</p>
<p>The fact that I am saying this here, and to you, is a sufficient
guaranty that I am to lay some emphasis on the part played by books
in these self-educative processes. A book is at once a carrier and
a tool; it transports the idea and plants it. It is a carrier both
in time and in space&mdash;the idea that it implants may be a
foreign idea, or an ancient idea, or both. Either of its functions
may for the moment be paramount; a book may bring to you ideas
whose implantation your brain resists, or it may be used to implant
ideas that are already present, as when an instructor uses his own
text book. Neither of these two cases represents education in the
fullest sense.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page246" name="page246"></a>[pg
246]</span>You will notice that I have not yet defined education. I
do not intend to try, for my time is limited. But in the course of
my own educative processes, which I trust are still proceeding, the
tendency grows stronger and stronger to insist on an intimate
connection with reality in all education&mdash;to making it a
realization that we are to do something and a yearning to be able
to do it. The man who has never run up against things as they are,
who has lived in a world of moonshine, who sees crooked and
attempts what is impossible and what is useless&mdash;is he
educated? I used to wonder what a realist was. Now that I am
becoming one myself I begin dimly to understand. He certainly is
not a man devoid of ideals, but they are real ideals, if you will
pardon the bull.</p>
<p>I believe that I am in goodly company. The library as I see it
has also set its face toward the real. What else is meant by our
business branches, our technology rooms, our legislative and
municipal reference departments? They mean that slow as we may be
to respond to community thought and to do our part in carrying on
community education, we are vastly more sensitive than the school,
which still turns up its nose at efforts like the Gary system; than
the stage, which still teaches its actors to be stagy instead of
natural; even than the producers of the very literature that we
help to circulate, who rarely know how even to represent the
conversation of two human beings as it really is. And when a great
new vehicle of popular artistic expression arises, like the moving
picture, those who purvey it spend their millions to build mock
cities instead of to reproduce the reality that it is their special
privilege to be able to show. And they hire stage actors to show
off their staginess on the screen&mdash;staginess that is a
thousand times more stagy because its background <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page247" name="page247"></a>[pg 247]</span>is of
waving foliage and glimmering water, instead of the painted canvas
in front of which it belongs. The heart of the community is right.
Its heroine is Mary Pickford. It rises to realism as one man. The
little dog who cannot pose, and who pants and wags his tail on the
screen as he would anywhere else, elicits thunderous applause. The
baby who puckers up its face and cries, oblivious of its
environment, is always a favorite. But the trend of all this, these
institutions cannot see. We librarians are seeing it a little more
clearly. We may see it&mdash;we shall see it, more clearly
still.</p>
<p>The self-education of a community often depends very closely on
bonds of connection already established between the minds of that
community&rsquo;s individual members. Sometimes it depends on a
sudden connection made through the agency of a single event of
overwhelming importance and interest. Let me illustrate what I mean
by connection of this kind. For many years it was my duty to cross
the Hudson river twice daily on a crowded ferry-boat, and it used
to interest me to watch the behavior of the crowds under the
influence of simple impulses affecting them all alike. I am happy
to say that I never had an opportunity of observing the effect of
complex impulses such as those of panic terror. I used particularly
to watch, from the vantage point of a stairway whence I could look
over their heads, the behavior of the crowd standing in the cabin
just before the boat made its landing. Each person in the crowd
stood still quietly, and the tendency was toward a loose formation
to ensure comfort and some freedom of movement. At the same time
each was ready and anxious to move forward as soon as the landing
should be made. Only those in front could see the bow of the
ferryboat; the others could see nothing but the persons
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page248" name="page248"></a>[pg
248]</span>directly in front of them. When those in the front rank
saw that the landing was very near they began to move forward;
those just behind followed suit and so on to the rear. The result
was that I saw a wave of compression, of the same sort as a
sound-wave in air, move through the throng. The individual motions
were forward but the wave moved backward. No better example of a
wave of this kind could be devised. Now the actions and reactions
between the air-particles in a sound wave are purely mechanical.
Not so here. There was neither pushing nor pulling of the ordinary
kind. Each person moved forward because his mind was fixed on
moving forward at the earliest opportunity, and because the forward
movement of those just in front showed him that now was the time
and the opportunity. The physical link, if there was one, properly
speaking, between one movement and another was something like this:
A wave of light, reflected from the body of the man in front,
entered the eye of the man just behind, where it was transformed
into a nerve impulse that readied the brain through the optic
nerve. Here it underwent complicated transformations and reactions
whose nature we can but surmise, until it left the brain as a motor
impulse and caused the leg muscles to contract, moving their owner
forward. All this may or may not have taken place within the sphere
of consciousness; in the most cases it had happened so often that
it had been relegated to that of unconscious cerebration.</p>
<p>I have entered into so much detail because I want to make it
clear that a connection may be established between members of a
group, even so casual a group as that of persons who happen to
cross on the same ferry boat, that is so real and compelling, that
its results simulate those of physical forces. In thin <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page249" name="page249"></a>[pg 249]</span>case
the results were dependent on the existence in the crowd of one
common bond of interest. They all wanted to leave the ferry boat as
soon as possible, and by its bow. If some of them had wanted to
stay on the boat and go back with it, or if it had been a river
steamboat where landings were made from several gangways in
different parts of the boat the simple wave of compression that I
saw would not have been set up. In like manner the ordinary
influences that act on men&rsquo;s minds tend in all sorts of
directions and their results are not easily traced. Occasionally,
however, there occurs some event so great that it turns us all in
the same direction and establishes a common network of psychical
connections. Such an event fosters community education.</p>
<p>We have lately witnessed such a phenomenon in the sudden
outbreak of the great European War. Probably no person in the
community as we librarians know it remained unaffected by this
event. In most it aroused some kind of a desire to know what was
going on. It was necessary that most of us should know a little
more than we did of the differences in racial temperament and aim
among the inhabitants of the warring nations, of such movements as
Pan-Slavism and Pan-Germanism, of the recent political history of
Europe, of modern military tactics and strategy, of international
law, of geography, of the pronunciation of foreign placenames, of
the chemistry of explosives&mdash;of a thousand things regarding
which we had hitherto lacked the impulse to inform ourselves. This
sort of thing is going on in a community every day, but here was a
catastrophe setting in motion a mighty brain-wave that had twisted
us all in one direction. Notice now what a conspicuous role our
public libraries play in phenomena of this kind. In the first
place, the news-paper <span class="pagenum"><a id="page250" name=
"page250"></a>[pg 250]</span>and periodical press reflects at once
the interest that has been aroused. Where man&rsquo;s unaided
curiosity would suggest one question it adds a hundred others.
Problems that would otherwise seem simple enough now appear
complex&mdash;the whole mental interest is intensified. At the same
time there is an attempt to satisfy the questions thus raised. The
man who did not know about the Belgian treaty, or the possible use
of submarines as commerce-destroyers, has all the issues put before
him with at least an attempt to settle them. This service of the
press to community education would be attempted, but it would not
be successfully rendered, without the aid of the public library,
for it has come to pass that the library is now almost the only
non-partisan institution that we possess; and community education,
to be effective, must be non-partisan. The press is almost
necessarily biassed. The man who is prejudiced prefers the paper or
the magazine that will cater to his prejudices, inflame them, cause
him to think that they are reasoned results instead of prejudices.
If he keeps away from the public library he may succeed in blinding
himself; if he uses it he can hardly do so. He will find there not
only his own side but all the others; if he has the ordinary
curiosity that is our mortal heritage he cannot help glancing at
the opinions of others occasionally. No man is really educated who
does not at least know that another side exists to the question on
which he has already made up his mind&mdash;or had it made up for
him.</p>
<p>Further, no one is content to stop with the ordinary periodical
literature. The flood of books inspired by this war is one of the
most astonishing things about it. Most libraries are struggling to
keep up with it in some degree. Very few of these books
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page251" name="page251"></a>[pg
251]</span>would be within the reach of most of us were it not for
the library.</p>
<p>I beg you to notice the difference in the reaction of the
library to this war and that of the public school as indicative of
the difference between formal educative processes, as we carry them
on, and the self-education of the community. I have emphasized the
freedom of the library from bias. The school is necessarily
biassed&mdash;perhaps properly so. You remember the story of the
candidate for a district school who, when asked by an examining
committee-man whether the earth was round or flat, replied,
&ldquo;Well, some says one and some t&rsquo;other. I teach either
round or flat, as the parents wish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now, there are books that maintain the flatness of the earth,
and they properly find a place on the shelves of large public
libraries. Those who wish to compare the arguments pro and con are
at liberty to do so. Even in such a <em>res adjudicata</em> as this
the library takes no sides. But in spite of the obliging school
candidate, the school cannot proceed in this way. The teaching of
the child must be definite. And there are other subjects,
historical ones for instance, in which the school&rsquo;s attitude
may be determined by its location, its environment, its management.
When it is a public school and its controlling authority is really
trying to give impartial instruction there are some subjects that
must simply be skipped, leaving them to be covered by
post-scholastic community education. This is the school&rsquo;s
limitation. Only the policy of caution is very apt to be carried
too far. Thus we find that in the school the immense educational
drive of the European War has not been utilized as it has in the
community at large. In some places the school authorities have
erected a barrier against it. So far as they are concerned
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page252" name="page252"></a>[pg
252]</span>the war has been non-existent. This difference between
the library and the school appears in such reports as the following
from a branch librarian:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Throughout the autumn and most of the winter we found it
absolutely impossible to supply the demand for books about the war.
Everything we had on the subject or akin to it&mdash;books,
magazines, pamphlets&mdash;were in constant use. Books of travel
and history about the warring countries became popular&mdash;things
that for years had been used but rarely became suddenly vitally
interesting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have been greatly interested by the fact that the high
school boys and girls never ask for anything about the war. Not
once during the winter have I seen in one of them a spark of
interest in the subject. It seems so strange that it should be
necessary to keep them officially ignorant of this great war
because the grandfather of one spoke French and of another
German.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another librarian says:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The war again has naturally stimulated an interest in
maps. With every turn in military affairs, new ones are issued and
added to our collection. These maps, as received, have been
exhibited for short periods upon screens and they have never lacked
an appreciative line of spectators, representing all
nationalities.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One noticeable effect of the war in libraries has been to
stimulate the marking of books, periodicals and newspapers by
readers, especially in periodical rooms. Readers with strong
feelings cannot resist annotating articles or chapters that express
opinions in which they cannot concur. Pictures of generals or
royalties are especially liable to defacement with opprobrious
epithets. This feeling extends even to bulletins. Libraries receive
strenuous protests <span class="pagenum"><a id="page253" name=
"page253"></a>[pg 253]</span>against the display of portraits and
other material relating to one of the contesting parties without
similar material on the other side to offset it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Efforts to be strictly neutral have not always met with
success, some readers apparently regarding neutrality as synonymous
with suppression of everything favorable to the opposite side. One
library reports that the display of an English military portrait
called forth an energetic protest because it was not balanced by a
German one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Such manifestations as these are merely symptoms. The impulse of
the war toward community education is a tremendous one and it is
not strange that it should find an outlet in all sorts of odd ways.
The German sympathizer who would not ordinarily think of objecting
to the display of an English portrait, and in fact would probably
not think of examining it closely enough to know whether it was
English or Austrian, has now become alert. His alertness makes him
open to educative influences, but it may also show itself in such
ways as that just noted.</p>
<p>Keeping the war out of the schools is of course a purely local
phenomenon, to be deprecated where it occurs. The library can do
its part here also.</p>
<p>&ldquo;G. Stanley Hall believes that the problem of teaching the
war is how to utilize in the very best way the wonderful
opportunity to open, see and feel the innumerable and vital lessons
involved.&rdquo; Commenting on this a children&rsquo;s librarian
says: &ldquo;The unparalleled opportunity offered to our country,
and the new complex problems presented by these new conditions
should make the children&rsquo;s librarian pause and take heed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can we do our part toward using the boy&rsquo;s loyalty
to his gang or his nine, his love of his country, <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page254" name="page254"></a>[pg 254]</span>his
respect for our flag, his devotion to our heroes, in developing a
sense of human brotherhood which alone can prevent or delay in the
next generation another such catastrophe as the one we face
to-day?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Exclusion of the war from the schools is partly the outcome of
the general attitude of most of our schoolmen, who object to the
teaching of a subject as an incidental. Arithmetic must be studied
for itself alone. To absorb it as a by-product of shop-work, as is
done in Gary, is inadmissible. But it is also a result of the fear
that teaching the war at all would necessarily mean a partisan
teaching of it&mdash;a conclusion which perhaps we cannot condemn
when we remember the partisan instruction in various other subjects
for which our schools are responsible.</p>
<p>Again, this exclusion is doubtless aided by the efforts of some
pacifists, who believe that, ostrich-like, we should hide our heads
in the sand, to avoid acknowledging the existence of something we
do not like. &ldquo;Why war?&rdquo; asks a recent pamphlet. Why,
indeed? But we may ask in turn &ldquo;Why fire?&rdquo; &ldquo;Why
flood?&rdquo; I cannot answer these questions, but it would be
foolish to act as if the scourges did not exist. Nay, I hasten to
insure myself against them, though the possibility that they will
injure me is remote. This ultra-pacifist attitude has gone further
than school education and is trying to put the lid on community
education also. Objection, for instance, has been made to an
exhibit of books, prints and posters about the war, which was
displayed in the St. Louis Public Library for nearly two months. We
intended to let it stand for about a week, but the public would not
allow this. The community insists on self-education even against
the will of its natural allies. The contention that we are
cultivating the innate blood-thirstiness of our public, I regard as
absurd.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page255" name="page255"></a>[pg
255]</span>What can we do toward generating or taking advantage of
other great driving impulses toward community education? Must we
wait for the horrors of a great war to teach us geography,
industrial chemistry and international law? Is it necessary to burn
down a house every time we want to roast a pig? Certainly not. But
just as one would not think of bringing on any kind of a
catastrophe in order to utilize its shock for educational purposes,
so also I doubt very much whether we need concern ourselves about
the initiation of any impulse toward popular education. These
impulses exist everywhere in great number and variety and we need
only to select the right one and reinforce it. Attempts to generate
others are rarely effective. When we hear the rich mellow tone of a
great organ pipe, it is difficult to realize that all the pipe does
is to reinforce a selected tone among thousands of
indistinguishable noises made by the air rushing through a slit and
striking against an edge. Yet this is the fact. These incipient
impulses permeate the community all about us; all we have to do is
to select one, feed it and give it play and we shall have an
&ldquo;educational movement.&rdquo; This fact is strongly impressed
upon anyone working with clubs. If it is desired to foster some
movement by means of an organization, it is rarely necessary to
form one for the purpose. Every community teems with clubs,
associations and circles. All that is needed is to capture the
right one and back it up. Politicians well understand this art of
capture and use it often for evil purposes. In the
librarian&rsquo;s hands it becomes an instrument for good. Better
than to offer a course of twenty lectures under the auspices of the
library is it to capture a club, give it house-room, and help it
with its program. I am proud of the fact that in fifteen public
rooms in <span class="pagenum"><a id="page256" name=
"page256"></a>[pg 256]</span>our library, about four thousand
meetings are held in the course of the year; but I am inclined to
be still prouder of the fact that not one of these is held formally
under the auspices of the library or is visibly patronized by it.
To go back to our thesis, all education is self-education; we can
only select, guide and strengthen, but when we have done these
things adequately, we have done a very great work indeed.</p>
<p>What is true of assemblies and clubs is also true of the
selection and use of books. A book purchased in response to a
demand is worth a dozen bought because the librarian thinks the
library ought to have them. The possibilities of free suggestion by
the community are, it seems to me, far from realized, yet even as
it is, I believe that librarians have an unexampled opportunity of
feeling out promising tendencies in this great flutter of
educational impulses all about us, and so of selecting the right
ones and helping them on.</p>
<p>Almost while I have been writing this I have been visited by a
delegate from the foundrymen&rsquo;s club&mdash;an organization
that wants more books on foundry practice and wants them placed
together in a convenient spot. Such a visit is of course a
heaven-sent opportunity and I suppose I betrayed something of my
pleasure in my manner. My visitor said, &ldquo;I am so glad you
feel this way about it; we have been meaning for some time to call
on you, but we were in doubt about how we should be
received.&rdquo; Such moments are humiliating to the librarian.
Great heavens! Have we advertised, discussed, talked and plastered
our towns with publicity, only to learn at last that the spokesman
of a body of respectable men, asking legitimate service, rather
expects to be kicked <span class="pagenum"><a id="page257" name=
"page257"></a>[pg 257]</span>downstairs than otherwise when he
approaches us? Is our publicity failing in quantity or in
quality?</p>
<p>Whatever may be the matter, it is in response to demands like
this that the library must play its part in community education.
Here as elsewhere it is the foundrymen who are the important
factors&mdash;their attitude, their desires, their capabilities.
Our function is that of the organ pipe&mdash;to pick out the
impulse, respond to it and give it volume and carrying power. The
community will educate itself whether we help or not. It is
permeated by lines of intelligence as the magnetic field is by
lines of force. Thrust in a bit of soft iron and the force-lines
will change their direction in order to pass through the iron.
Thrust a book into the community field, and its lines of
intelligence will change direction in order to take in the contents
of the book. If we could map out the field we should see great
masses of lines sweeping through our public libraries.</p>
<p>All about us we see men who tell us that they despair of
democracy; that at any rate, whatever its advantages, democracy can
never be &ldquo;efficient.&rdquo; Efficient for what? Efficiency is
a relative quality, not absolute. A big German howitzer would be
about as inefficient a tool as could be imagined, for serving an
apple-pie. Beside, democracy is a goal; we have not reached it yet;
we shall never reach it if we decide that it is undesirable. The
path toward it is the path of Nature, which leads through
conflicts, survivals, and modifications. Part of it is the path of
community education, which I believe to be efficient in that it is
leading on toward a definite goal. Part of Nature is man, with his
desires, hopes and abilities. Some men, and many women, are
librarians, in whom these desires and hopes have definite
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page258" name="page258"></a>[pg
258]</span>aims and in whom the corresponding abilities are more or
less developed. We are all thus cogs in Nature&rsquo;s great scheme
for community education; let us be intelligent cogs, and help the
movement on instead of hindering it.</p>

<h2><a name="Essay22" id="Essay22">Clubwomen&rsquo;s
Reading</a></h2>
<p class="returnTOC"><a href="#Contents">Return to Table of
Contents</a></p>
<h3>I&mdash;<em>The Malady</em></h3>
<p>A well-dressed woman entered the Art Department of a large
public library. &ldquo;Have you any material on the Medici?&rdquo;
she asked the custodian. &ldquo;Yes; just what kind of material do
you want?&rdquo; &ldquo;Stop a minute,&rdquo; cried the woman,
extending a detaining hand; &ldquo;before you get me anything, just
tell me what they are!&rdquo; Librarians are trained not to laugh.
No one could have detected the ghost of a smile on this one&rsquo;s
face as she lifted the &ldquo;M&rdquo; volume of a cyclopedia from
a shelf and placed it on the table before the seeker after
knowledge. &ldquo;There; that will tell you,&rdquo; she said, and
returned to her work.</p>
<p>Not long afterward she was summoned by a beckoning finger.
&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t tell from this book,&rdquo; said the perplexed
student, &ldquo;whether the Medici were a family or a race of
people.&rdquo; The Art Librarian tried to untie this knot, but it
was not long before another presented itself. &ldquo;This book
doesn&rsquo;t explain,&rdquo; said the troubled investigator,
&ldquo;whether the Medici were Florentines or Italians.&rdquo;
Still without a quiver, the art assistant emitted the required drop
of information. &ldquo;Shan&rsquo;t I get you something more
now?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;Oh, no; this will be quite
sufficient,&rdquo; and taking out pencil and paper the inquirer
began to write rapidly with the cyclopedia propped before her.
Presently, when the Art Librarian looked up, her guest had
disappeared. But she was on hand the next morning. &ldquo;May I see
that book again?&rdquo; she <span class="pagenum"><a id="page260"
name="page260"></a>[pg 260]</span>asked sweetly. &ldquo;There are
some words here in my copy that I can&rsquo;t quite make
out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On another occasion a reader, of the same sex, wandered into the
reading-room and began to gaze about her with that peculiar sort of
perplexed aimlessness that librarians have come to recognise
instinctively as an index to the wearer&rsquo;s state of mind.
&ldquo;Have you anything on American travels?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean travels in America, or travels by Americans
in foreign countries?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well; I don&rsquo;t know&mdash;exactly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you want books like Dickens&rsquo;s <em>American
Notes</em>, that give a foreigner&rsquo;s impression of this
country?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye-es&mdash;possibly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or books like Hawthorne&rsquo;s <em>Note Book</em>,
telling how a foreign country appears to an American?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We-ell; perhaps.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you following a programme of reading?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;May I see it? That may give me a clue.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t a copy here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you give me the name of the person or committee who
made it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I <em>made</em> it <em>myself</em>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was a &ldquo;facer&rdquo;; the librarian seemed to have
brought up against a stone wall, but she waited, knowing that a
situation, unlike a knot, will sometimes untie itself.</p>
<p>The seeker after knowledge also waited for a time. Then she
broke out animatedly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, I just wanted American travels, don&rsquo;t you
know? Funny little stories and things about the sort of Americans
that go abroad with a bird-cage!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just what books were given to her I do not know; <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page261" name="page261"></a>[pg 261]</span>but in
due time her interesting paper before the Olla Podrida Club was
properly noticed in the local papers.</p>
<p>In another case a perplexed club-woman came to a library for aid
in making a programme of reading. &ldquo;Have you some ideas about
the subject you want to take up?&rdquo; asked the reference
assistant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we had thought of England, or perhaps Scotland; and
some of us would like the Elizabethan Period.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The assistant, after some faithful work, produced a list of
books and articles on each of these somewhat comprehensive subjects
and sent them to the reader for selection. &ldquo;Which did you
finally take?&rdquo; she asked when the inquirer next visited the
library.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, they were so good, we decided to use all of them this
year!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The writer is no pessimist. These stories which are as true,
word for word, as any tales not taken down by a stenographer (and
far more so than some that are) seemed to throw the persons who
told them into a sort of dumb despair, but I hastened to reassure
them. I pointed out that the inquirers after knowledge had, beyond
all doubt, obtained some modicum of what they wanted. If the lady
in the first tale, for instance, had mistakenly supposed that the
Medici were a new kind of dance or something to eat, she surely has
been disabused. And her cyclopedia article was probably as well
written as most of its kind, so that a literal transcript of it
could have done no harm either to the copyist or to her clubmates.
And the paper on &ldquo;American Travels,&rdquo; and the combined
lists on England, Scotland and the Elizabethan Period; did not
those who laboured on them, or with them, acquire information in
the process? Most assuredly!</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page262" name="page262"></a>[pg
262]</span>Still, I must confess that, in advancing these
arguments, I feel somewhat like an <em>advocatus diaboli</em>. It
is all very well to treat the puzzled clubwoman as a joke. When a
man slips on a banana-peel and goes down, we may laugh at his
plight; but suppose the whole crowd of passers-by began to pitch
and slide and tumble! Should we not think that some horrible
epidemic had laid its hand on us? The ladies with their Medici and
their Travels are not isolated instances. Ask the librarians; they
know, but in countless instances they do not tell, for fear of
casting ridicule upon the hundreds of intelligent clubwomen whom
they are proud to help. In many libraries there is a standing rule
against repeating or discussing the errors and slips of the public,
especially to the ever hungry reporter. I break this rule here with
equanimity, and even with a certain degree of hope, for my object
is to awaken my readers to the knowledge that part of the reading
public is suffering from a malady of some kind. Later I may try my
hand at diagnosis and even at therapeutics. And I am taking as an
illustration chiefly the reading done by women&rsquo;s clubs, not
because men do not do reading of the same kind, or because it is
not done by individuals as well as by groups; but because, just at
the present time, women in general, and clubwomen in particular,
seem especially likely to be attacked by the disease. It must be
remembered also that I am writing from the standpoint of the public
library, and I here make humble acknowledgement of the fact that
many things in the educational field, both good and bad, go on
quite outside of that institution and beyond its ken.</p>
<p>The intellectual bonds between the library and the woman&rsquo;s
club have always been close. Many libraries <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page263" name="page263"></a>[pg 263]</span>are the
children of such clubs; many clubs have been formed in and by
libraries. If any mistakes are being made in the general policies
and programmes of club reading, the librarian would naturally be
the first to know it, and he ought to speak out. He does know it,
and his knowledge should become public property at once. But, I
repeat, although the trouble is conspicuous in connection with the
reading of women&rsquo;s clubs, it is far more general and deeply
rooted than this.</p>
<p>The malady&rsquo;s chief symptom, which is well known to all
librarians, is a lack of correspondence between certain readers and
the books that they choose. Reading, like conversation, is the
meeting of two minds. If there is no contact, the process fails. If
the cogs on the gearwheels do not interact, the machine can not
work. If the reader of a book on algebra does not understand
arithmetic; if he tackles a philosophical essay on the
representative function without knowing what the phrase means; if
he tries to read a French book without knowing the language, his
mind is not fitted for contact with that of the writer, and the
mental machinery will not move.</p>
<p>In the early days of the Open Shelf, before librarians had
realised the necessity of copious assignments to &ldquo;floor
duty,&rdquo; and before there were children&rsquo;s librarians, I
saw in a branch library a small child staggering under the weight
of a volume of Schaff&rsquo;s <em>History of the Christian
Church</em>, which he had taken from the shelves and was presenting
at the desk to be charged. &ldquo;You are not going to read that,
are you?&rdquo; said the desk assistant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t for me; it&rsquo;s for me big
brudder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did your big brother ask you to get?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, a Physiology!&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page264" name="page264"></a>[pg
264]</span>Nowadays, our well-organised children&rsquo;s rooms make
such an occurrence doubtful with the little ones, but apparently
there is much of it with adults.</p>
<p>Too much of our reading&mdash;I should rather say our attempts
at reading&mdash;is of this character. Such attempts are the result
of a tendency to regard the printed page as a fetich&mdash;to think
that if one knows his alphabet and can call the printed words one
after another as his eye runs along the line, some unexplained good
will result, or at least that he has performed a praiseworthy act,
has &ldquo;accumulated merit&rdquo; somehow or somewhere, like a
Thibetan with his prayer-wheel.</p>
<p>It is probably a fact that if a man should meet you in the
street and say, &ldquo;In beatific repentance lies jejune
responsibility,&rdquo; you would stare at him and pass him by, or
perhaps flee from him as from a lunatic; whereas if you saw these
words printed in a book you might gravely study them to ascertain
their meaning, or still worse, might succeed in reading your own
meaning into them. The words I have strung together happen to have
no meaning, but the result would be the same if they meant
something that was hidden from the reader by his inability to
understand them, no matter what the cause of that inability might
be.</p>
<p>This malady is doubtless spontaneous in some degree, and
dependent on failings of the human mind that we need not discuss
here, but there are signs that it is being fostered, spread, and
made more acute by special influences. Probably our educational
methods are not altogether blameless. The boy who trustfully
approached a Reference Librarian and said, &ldquo;I have to write a
composition on what I saw between home and school; have you got a
book about that?&rdquo; had doubtless been taught that he must look
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page265" name="page265"></a>[pg
265]</span>in a book for everything. The conscientious teacher who
was now trying to separate him from his notion may have been the
very one who, perhaps unconsciously, had instilled it; if so, her
fault had thus returned to plague her.</p>
<p>The boy or girl who comes to attach a sacredness or a wizardry
to the book in itself will naturally believe, after a little, that
whether he understands what is in it matters little&mdash;and this
is the malady of which we have been complaining.</p>
<p>A college teacher of the differential calculus, in a time now
happily long past, when a pupil timidly inquired the reason for
this or that, was wont to fix the interrogator with his eye and
say, &ldquo;Sir; it is so because the book says so!&rdquo; Even in
more recent days a well-known university teacher, accustomed to use
his own text-book, used to say when a student had ventured to vary
its classic phraseology, &ldquo;It can not be expressed better than
in the words of the book!?&rdquo; These instances, of course, are
taken from the dark ages of education, but even to-day I believe
that a false idea of the value of a printed page merely as
print&mdash;not as the record of a mind, ready to make contact with
the mind of a reader&mdash;has impressed itself too deeply on the
brains of many children at an age when such impressions are apt to
be durable. Not that the schools are especially at fault; we have
all played our part in this unfortunate business. It might all
fade, at length; we all know that many good teachings of our
childhood do vanish; why should not the bad ones occasionally
follow suit?</p>
<p>But now come in all the well-meaning instructors of the
adult&mdash;the Chautauquans, the educational extensionists, the
lecturers, the correspondence schools, the advisers of reading, the
makers of booklists, the devisers of &ldquo;courses.&rdquo; They
deepen the fleeting impression <span class="pagenum"><a id=
"page266" name="page266"></a>[pg 266]</span>and increase its
capacity for harm, while varying slightly the mechanism that
produced it. As the child grows into a man, his childish idea that
a book will produce a certain effect independently of what it
contains is apt to yield a little to reason. The new influences,
some of which I have named above, do not attempt directly to combat
this dawning intelligence; they utilise it to complete the mental
discomfiture of their victims. They admit the necessity of
comprehending the contents of the book, but they persuade the
reader that such comprehension is easier than it really is. And
they often administer specially concocted tabloids that convince
one that he knows more than he really does. Thus the unsuspecting
adult goes on reading what he does not understand, not now thinking
that it does not matter, but falsely persuaded that he has become
competent to understand.</p>
<p>Every one of the agencies that I have named aims to do good
educational work; every one is competent to do such work; nearly
every one does much of it. I am finding fault with them only so far
as they succeed in persuading readers that they are better educated
than they really are. In this respect such agencies are precisely
on a par with the proprietary medicine that is an excellent
laxative or sudorific, but is offered also as a cure for
tuberculosis or cancer.</p>
<p>I once heard the honoured head of a famous body that does an
enormous amount of work of this sort deliver an <em>apologia</em>,
deserving of all attention, in which he complained that his
institution had been falsely accused of superficiality. It was, he
said, perfectly honest in what it taught. If its pupils thought
that the elementary knowledge they were gaining was comprehensive
and thorough, that was their fault&mdash;not his. And vet, at that
moment, the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page267" name=
"page267"></a>[pg 267]</span>institution was posing before its
pupils as a &ldquo;university&rdquo; and using the forms and
nomenclature of such a body to strengthen the idea in their minds.
We cannot acquit it, or any of the agencies like it, of complicity
in the causation of the malady whose symptoms we are
discussing.</p>
<p>It is not the fault of the women&rsquo;s clubs that they have
fallen into line in such an imposing procession as this. Their
formation and work constitute one of the most interesting and
important manifestations of the present feminist movement. Their
r&ocirc;le in it is partly social, partly educational; and as they
consist of adults, elementary education is of course excluded from
their programme. We therefore find them committed, perhaps
unconsciously, to the plan of required or recommended reading, in a
form that has long been the bane of our educational systems both in
school and out.</p>
<p>One of the corner-stones of this system is the idea that the
acquisition of information is valuable in itself, no matter what
may be the relationship between it and the acquiring mind, or what
use of it may be made in the future. According to this idea, if a
woman can once get into her head that the Medici were a family and
not &ldquo;a race of people,&rdquo; it matters little that she is
unfitted to comprehend why they are worth reading about at all, or
that the fact has nothing to do with what she has ever done or is
likely to be called upon to do in the future.</p>
<p>That the members of these clubs are willing to pursue knowledge
under these hampering conditions is of course a point in their
favour, so far as it goes. A desire for knowledge is never to be
despised, even when it is not entertained for its own sake. And a
secondary desire may often be changed into a primary one, if the
task is approached in the right way. <span class="pagenum"><a id=
"page268" name="page268"></a>[pg 268]</span>The possibility of such
a transformation is a hopeful feature of the present situation.</p>
<p>The reading that is done by women in connection with club work
is of several different types. In the simplest organisations, which
are reading clubs pure and simple, a group of books, roughly equal
in number to the membership, is taken and passed around until each
person has read them all. There is no connection between them, and
each volume is selected simply on some one&rsquo;s statement that
it is a &ldquo;good book.&rdquo; A step higher is the club where
the books are on one general subject, selected by some one who has
been asked to prescribe a &ldquo;course of reading.&rdquo; By easy
gradations we arrive at the final stage, where the reading is of
the nature of investigation and its outcome is an essay. A subject
is decided on at the beginning of the season. The programme
committee selects several phases of it and assigns each to a
member, who prepares her essay and reads it to the club at one of
the stated meetings. In this case the reading to be done in
preparation for writing the essay may or may not be guided by the
committee. In many cases, where the local public library cooperates
actively with the clubs, a list may be made out by the librarian
and perhaps printed, with due acknowledgment, in the club&rsquo;s
year book. No one can doubt, in looking over typical programmes and
lists among the thousands that represent the annual reading of the
women&rsquo;s clubs throughout the United States, that a serious
and sustained effort is being made to introduce the intellect, as
an active factor, into the lives of thousands of women&mdash;lives
where hitherto it has played little part, whether they are
millionaires or near paupers, workers or idlers. With this aim
there must be frill measure of sympathy, but I fear we can commend
it only in the back-handed <span class="pagenum"><a id="page269"
name="page269"></a>[pg 269]</span>fashion in which a great
authority on sociology recently commended the Socialists. &ldquo;If
sympathy with what they are trying to do, as opposed to the way in
which they are trying to do it, makes one a Socialist,&rdquo; said
the Professor, &ldquo;then I am a Socialist.&rdquo; Here also we
may sympathise with the aim, but the results are largely dependent
on the method; and that method is the offspring of ignorance and
inefficiency. The results may be summed up in one
word&mdash;superficiality. I have elsewhere warned readers not to
think that this word means simply a slight knowledge of, a subject.
A slight knowledge is all that most of us possess, or need to
possess, about most subjects. I know a little about Montenegro for
instance&mdash;something of its origin and relationships, its
topography, the names and characteristics of a city or two, the
racial and other peculiarities of its inhabitants. Yet I should cut
a poor figure indeed in an examination on Montenegrin history,
geography or government. Is my knowledge &ldquo;superficial&rdquo;?
It could not properly be so stigmatised unless I should pose as an
authority on Montenegro, or unless my opportunities to know about
the country had been so great that failure to take advantage of
them should argue mental incapacity. The trouble with the
reading-lists and programmes of our women&rsquo;s clubs, inherited
in some degree from our general educational methods, is that they
emphasise their own content and ignore what they do not contain, to
such an extent that those who use them remain largely in ignorance
of the fact that the former bears a very small proportion indeed to
the latter.</p>
<p>It was once my duty to act as private tutor in algebra and
geometry to a young man preparing for college. He was bright and
industrious, but I found <span class="pagenum"><a id="page270"
name="page270"></a>[pg 270]</span>that he was under the impression
that when he had gone to the end of his text-books in those two
subjects he would have mastered, not only all the algebra and
geometry, but all the mathematics, that the world held in store.
And when this story has been told in despair to some very
intelligent persons they have commented: &ldquo;Well, there
isn&rsquo;t much more, is there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The effort of the text-book writer, as well as that of the maker
of programmes, lists, and courses, appears to have been to produce
what he calls a &ldquo;well-rounded&rdquo; effect; in other words,
to make the student think that the whole subject&mdash;in condensed
form perhaps, but still the whole&mdash;lies within what he has
turned out. Did you ever see a chemistry that gave, or tried to
give, an idea of the world of chemical knowledge that environs its
board cover? One has to become a Newton before he feels, with that
sage, like a child, playing on the sands, with the great,
unexplored ocean of knowledge stretching out before him. Most
students are rather like ducks in a barn-yard puddle, quite sure
that they are familiar with the whole world and serene in that
knowledge.</p>
<p>Most writers of text-books would indignantly deny that this
criticism implies a fault. It is none of their business, they would
say, to call attention to what is beyond their scope. So be it.
Unfortunately, every one feels in the same way and so the horizon
of our women&rsquo;s clubs is that of the puddle instead of the
ocean.</p>
<p>It is a most interesting fact in this connection that there
exist certain organisations which make a business of furnishing
clubwomen with information for their papers. I have heard this
service described as a &ldquo;godsend,&rdquo; to clubs in small
places where there are no libraries, or where the libraries are
poorly <span class="pagenum"><a id="page271" name="page271"></a>[pg
271]</span>equipped with books and <em>personnel</em>. But, if I am
correctly informed, the service does not stop with the supply of
raw material; it goes on to the finished product, and the perplexed
lady who is required to read a paper on &ldquo;Melchisedek&rdquo;
or on &ldquo;Popular Errors Regarding the Theory of Groups,&rdquo;
may for an adequate fee, or possibly even for an inadequate one,
obtain a neatly typewritten manuscript on the subject, ready to
read.</p>
<p>This sort of thing is not at all to be wondered at. It has gone
on since the dawn of time with college theses, clergymen&rsquo;s
sermons, the orations and official papers of statesmen. Whenever a
man is confronted with an intellectual task that he dare not shirk,
and yet has not the intellect or the interest to perform, the first
thing he thinks of is to hire some one to do it for him, and this
demand has always been great enough and widespread enough to make
it profitable for some one to organise the supply on a commercial
basis. What interests us in the present case is the fact that its
existence in the woman&rsquo;s club affords an instant clue to the
state of mind of many of its members. They have this in common with
the plagiarising pupil, clergyman, or statesman&mdash;they are
called upon to do something in which they have only a secondary
interest. The minister who reads a sermon on the text &ldquo;Thou
Shalt Not Steal,&rdquo; and considers that the fact that he has
paid five dollars for it will absolve him from the charge of
inconsistency, does not&mdash;cannot&mdash;feel any desire to
impress his congregation with a desire for right living&mdash;he
wants only to hold his job. The university student who, after
ascertaining that there is no copyable literature in the Library on
&ldquo;Why I Came to College,&rdquo; pays a classmate a dollar to
give this information to the Faculty, cares nothing about the
question; but he <span class="pagenum"><a id="page272" name=
"page272"></a>[pg 272]</span>does care to avoid discipline. So the
clubwoman who reads a purchased essay on &ldquo;Ireland in the
Fourteenth Century,&rdquo; has not the slightest interest in the
subject; but she does want to remain a member of her club, in good
and regular standing. It is the same substitution of adventitious
for natural motives and stimuli that works intellectual havoc from
the mother&rsquo;s knee up to the Halls of Congress.</p>
<p>When I assert boldly that at the present time the majority of
vague and illogical readers are women, and that women&rsquo;s clubs
are responsible for much of that kind of reading, I shall doubtless
incur the displeasure of the school of feminists who seem bent on
minimising the differences between the two sexes. Obvious physical
differences they have not been able to explain away, and to deny
that corresponding mental differences exist is to shut one&rsquo;s
eyes to all the teachings of modern physiology. The mental life is
a function, not of the brain alone, but of the whole nervous system
of which the brain is but the principal ganglion. Cut off a
man&rsquo;s legs, and you have removed something from his mental,
as well as from his physical equipment. That men and women should
have minds of the same type is a physiological impossibility. A
familiar way of stating the difference is to say that in the
man&rsquo;s mind reason predominates, in the woman&rsquo;s,
intuition. There is doubtless something to be said for this
statement of the distinction, but it is objectionable because it is
generally interpreted to mean&mdash;quite unnecessarily&mdash;that
a woman&rsquo;s mind is inferior to a man&rsquo;s&mdash;a
distinction about as foolish as it would be to say the negative
electricity is inferior to positive, or cold to heat. The types are
in most ways supplementary, and a combination of the two has always
been a potent intellectual force&mdash;one of the strongest
arguments for marriage as an institution. <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page273" name="page273"></a>[pg 273]</span>When we
try to do the work of the world with either type alone we have
generally made a mess of it. And the outcome seems to make it
probable that the female type is especially prone to become the
prey of fallacies like that which has brought about the present
flood of useless, or worse than useless, reading.</p>
<p>I shall doubtless be asked whether I assert that one type of
mind belongs always to the man and one to the woman. By no means. I
do not even lay emphasis on the necessity of naming the two types
&ldquo;male&rdquo; and &ldquo;female.&rdquo; All I say is that the
types exist&mdash;with those intermediate cases that always bother
the classifier&mdash;and that the great majority of men possess one
type and the great majority of women the other. It is possible that
differences of training may have originated or at least emphasised
the types; it is possible that future training may obliterate the
lines that separate them, but I do not believe it. I am even afraid
of trying the experiment, for there is reason to believe that its
success in the mental field might react unfavourably on those
physical differences on which the future of the race depends. We
may have gone too far in this direction already; else why the
feverish anxiety of the girls&rsquo; colleges to prove that their
graduates are marrying and bearing children?</p>
<p>The fact is that the problem of the education of the sexes is
not yet solved. Educating one sex alone didn&rsquo;t work; neither,
I believe, does the present plan of educating both alike, whether
in the same institution, or separately.</p>
<h3>II&mdash;<em>A Diagnosis</em></h3>
<p>Reading, like conversation, is, or ought to be, a contact
between two minds. The difference is that while one may talk only
with his contemporaries and <span class="pagenum"><a id="page274"
name="page274"></a>[pg 274]</span>neighbours one may read the words
of a writer far distant both in time and space. It is no wonder,
perhaps, that the printed word has become a fetish, but fetishes of
any kind are not in accordance with the spirit of the age, and
their veneration should be discouraged. Reading in which the
contact of minds is of secondary importance, or even cuts no figure
at all, is meaningless and valueless.</p>
<p>In a previous paper, reasons have been given for believing that
reading of this kind is peculiarly prevalent among the members of
women&rsquo;s clubs. The value of these organisations is so great,
and the services that they have rendered to women, and through them
to the general cause of social betterment, are so evident, that it
seems well worth while to examine the matter a little more closely,
and to complete a diagnosis based on the study of the symptoms that
have already presented themselves. As most of the reading done in
connection with clubs is in preparation for the writing and reading
of papers, we may profitably, perhaps, direct our attention to this
phase of the subject.</p>
<p>Most persons will agree, probably, that the average club paper
is not notably worth while. It is written by a person not primarily
and vitally interested in the subject, and it is read to an
assemblage most of whom are similarly devoid of interest&mdash;the
whole proceeding being more or less perfunctory. Could it be
expected that reading done in connection with such a performance
should be valuable?</p>
<p>This is worth pondering, because it is a fact that almost all
the vital informative literature that is produced at first hand
sees the light in connection with clubs and
associations&mdash;bodies that publish journals,
&ldquo;transactions&rdquo; or &ldquo;proceedings&rdquo; for the
especial purpose of printing the productions of their members.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page275" name="page275"></a>[pg
275]</span> This literature, for the most part, does not come to
the notice of the general reader. The ordinary books on the
technical subjects of which it treats are not raw material, but a
manufactured product&mdash;compilations from the original sources.
And the pity of it is that very many of them, often the best of
them from a purely literary point of view, are so unsatisfactory,
viewed from the point of view of accomplishment. They do not do
what they set out to do; they are full of misunderstandings,
misinterpretations, interpolations and omissions. It is the old
story; those who know won&rsquo;t tell and the task is assumed by
those who are eminently able to tell, but don&rsquo;t know. The
scientific expert despises the public, which is forced to get its
information through glib but ignorant expounders. This is a
digression, but it may serve to illuminate the situation, which is
that the authoritative literature of special subjects sees the
light almost wholly in the form of papers, read before clubs and
associations. Evidently there is nothing in the mere fact that a
paper is to be read before a club, to make it trivial or valueless.
Yet how much that is of value to the world first saw the light in a
paper read before a woman&rsquo;s club? How much original thought,
how much discovery, how much invention, how much inspiration, is
put into their writing and emanates from their reading?</p>
<p>There must be a fundamental difference of some kind between the
constitution and the methods of these two kinds of clubs. A study
of this difference will throw light on the kind of reading that
must be done in connection with each and may explain, in great
part, why the reading done for women&rsquo;s club-papers is what it
is.</p>
<p>A scientific or technical society exists largely for the purpose
of informing its members of the original <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page276" name="page276"></a>[pg 276]</span>work
that is being done by each of them. When anyone has accomplished
such work or has made such progress that he thinks an account of
what he has done would be interesting, he sends a description of it
to the proper committee, which decides whether it shall be read and
discussed at a meeting, or published in the Proceedings, or both,
or neither. The result depends on the size of the membership, on
its activity, and on the value of its work. It may be that the
programme committee has an embarrassment of riches from which to
select, or that there is poverty instead. But in no case does it
arrange a programme. The Physical Society, if that is its name and
subject, does not decide that it will devote the meetings of the
current season to a consideration of Radio-activity and assign to
specified members the reading of papers on Radio-active springs,
the character of Radium Emanation, and so on. If it did, it would
doubtless get precisely the same results that we are complaining of
in the case of the Woman&rsquo;s Club. A man whose specialty is
thermodynamics might be told off to prepare a paper on Radio-active
Elements in Rocks&mdash;a subject in which he is not interested. He
could have nothing new nor original to say on the subject and his
paper would be a mere compilation. It would not even be a good
compilation, for his interest and his skill would lie wholly in
another direction. The good results that the society does get are
wholly dependent on the fact that each writer is full of new
information that he desires, above all things, to communicate to
his fellow-members.</p>
<p>In the preparation of such a paper, one needs, of course, to
read, and often to read widely. Much of the reading will be done in
connection with the work described, or even before it is begun. No
one wishes to undertake an investigation that has already been made
by someone else, and so the first thing that a <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page277" name="page277"></a>[pg
277]</span>competent investigator does is to survey his field and
ascertain what others have accomplished in it. This task is by no
means easy, for such information is often hidden in journals and
transactions that are difficult to reach, and the published indexes
of such material, though wonderfully advanced on the road toward
perfection in the past twenty years, have yet far to travel before
they reach it, Not only the writer&rsquo;s description of what he
has done or ascertained, but the character of the work itself; the
direction it takes&mdash;the inferences that he draws from it, will
be controlled and coloured by what he reads of others&rsquo; work.
And even if he finds it easy to ascertain what has been done and to
get at the published accounts and discussions of it, the mass may
be so great that he has laid out for him a course of reading that
may last many months.</p>
<p>But mark the spirit with which he attacks it! He is at work on
something that seems to him supremely worth while. He is labouring
to find out truth, to dissipate error, to help his fellow-men to
know something or to do something. The impulse to read, and to read
much and thoroughly, is so powerful that it may even need judicious
repression. The difference between this kind of reading and that
done in the preparation of a paper to fill a place in a set
programme hardly needs emphasis.</p>
<p>The preparation of papers for professional and technical
societies has been dwelt upon at such length, because I see no
reason why the impulse to reading that it furnishes cannot also be
placed at the disposal of the woman&rsquo;s club; and I shall have
some suggestions toward this end in a future article.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, I shall doubtless be told that it is unfair to
compare the woman&rsquo;s club, with its didactic aim, and the
scientific association of trained and interested <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page278" name="page278"></a>[pg
278]</span>investigators. It is true that we have plenty of
clubs&mdash;some of men alone, some of both sexes&mdash;whose
object is to listen to interesting and instructive papers on a set
subject, often forming part of a pre-arranged programme. These,
however, need our attention here only so far as the papers are
prepared by members of the club, and in this case they are in
precisely the same class as the woman&rsquo;s club. In many cases,
however, the paper is merely the excuse for a social gathering,
perhaps at a dinner or a luncheon. Of course if the paper or
lecture is by an expert invited to give it, the case falls
altogether outside of the region that we are exploring.</p>
<p>I am condemning here all clubs, formed for an avowed educational
or cultural purpose, that adopt set programmes and assign the
subjects to their own members. I am deploring the kind of reading
to which this leads, the kind of papers that are prepared in this
way, and the kind of thought and action that are the inevitable
outcome.</p>
<p>It would seem that the women&rsquo;s clubs now form an immense
majority of all organisations of this kind and that there are
reasons for warning women that they are specially prone to this
kind of mistake.</p>
<p>The diversity of interests of the average man, the wideness of
his contacts&mdash;the whole tradition of his sex&mdash;tends to
minimise the injury that may be done to him, intellectually and
spiritually, by anything of this kind. The very fact that he is the
woman&rsquo;s inferior spiritually, and in many cases, in
intellect, also&mdash;although probably not at the
maximum&mdash;relieves him, in great part, of the odium attaching
to the error that has been described. Women are becoming keenly
alive to the deficiencies of their sex-tradition; they are trying
to broaden their intellectual contacts&mdash;that is the great
modern feminist movement. Some <span class="pagenum"><a id=
"page279" name="page279"></a>[pg 279]</span>of those who are active
in it are making two mistakes&mdash;they are ignoring the
differences between the sexes and they are trying to substitute
revolution for evolution. In this latter error they are in very
good company&mdash;hardly one of the great and the good has not
made it, at some time and in some way. Revolution is always the
outcome of a mistake. The mistake may be antecedent and
irrevocable, and the revolution therefore necessary, but this is
rarely the case. The revolutionist runs a risk common to all who
are in a hurry&mdash;he may break the object of his attention
instead of moving it. When he wants to hand you a dish he hits it
with a ball-bat. Taking a reasonable amount of time is better in
the long run.</p>
<p>That there is no royal road to knowledge has long been
recognised. The trouble with most of us is that we have interpreted
this to mean that the acquisition of knowledge must always be a
distasteful process. On the contrary, the vivid interest that is
the surest guide to knowledge is also the surest smoother of the
path. Given the interest that lures the student on, and he will
spend years in surmounting rocks and breaking through thorny
jungles, realising their difficulties perhaps, but rejoicing the
more when those difficulties prove no obstacles.</p>
<p>The fact that the first step toward accomplishment is to create
an interest has long been recognised, but attempts have been made
too often to do it by devious ways, unrelated to the matter in
hand. Students have been made to study history or algebra by
offering prizes to the diligent and by threatening the slothful
with punishment. More indirect rewards and punishments abound in
all our incitements to effort and need not be mentioned here. They
may often be effective, but the further removed they are from
direct personal interest in the subject, the <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page280" name="page280"></a>[pg 280]</span>weaker
and the less permanent is the result. You may offer a boy a dollar
to learn certain facts in English history, but those facts will not
be fixed so well or so lastingly in his mind as those connected
with his last year&rsquo;s trip to California, which he remembers
easily without offer of reward or threat of punishment.</p>
<p>The interest in the facts gathered by reading in connection with
the average club paper is merely the result of a desire to remain
in good standing by fulfilling the duties of membership; and these
duties may be fulfilled with slight effort and no direct interest,
as we have already seen.</p>
<p>If interest were present even at the inception of the programme,
something would be gained; but in too many cases it is not. The
programme committee must make some kind of a programme, but what it
is to be they know little and care less.</p>
<p>Two women recently entered a branch library and asked the
librarian, who was busy charging books at the desk, what two
American dramatists she considered &ldquo;foremost.&rdquo; This was
followed by the request, &ldquo;Please tell me the two best plays
of each of them.&rdquo; A few minutes later the querists returned
and asked the same question about English dramatists, and still
later about German, Russian, Italian and Spanish writers of the
drama. Each time they eagerly wrote down the information and then
retired to the reading-room for a few minutes&rsquo;
consultation.</p>
<p>Finally they propounded a question that was beyond the
librarian&rsquo;s knowledge, and then she asked why they wanted to
know.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are making out the programme for our next year&rsquo;s
study course in the Blank Club,&rdquo; was the answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you mustn&rsquo;t take my opinion as final,&rdquo;
protested <span class="pagenum"><a id="page281" name=
"page281"></a>[pg 281]</span>the scandalised librarian. &ldquo;You
ought to read up everything you can find about dramatists. I may
have left out the most important ones.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This will do nicely,&rdquo; said the club-woman, as she
folded her sheets of paper. And it did&mdash;whether nicely or not
deponent saith not? but it certainly constituted the club
programme.</p>
<p>On another occasion a clubwoman entered the library and said
with an air of importance, &ldquo;I want your material on Susanna
H. Brown.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The librarian had never heard of Susanna, but experience had
taught her modesty and also a certain degree of guile, so she
merely said, &ldquo;What do you want to know about her,
particularly?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our club wishes to discuss her contributions to American
literature.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now the Brown family has been active in letters, from Charles
Brockden down to Alice, but no one seems to know of Susanna H. The
librarian contrived to put off the matter until she could make some
investigations of her own, but, all the resources of the central
reference room proving unequal to the task, she timidly asked the
clubwoman, at her next visit, to solve the problem.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, we don&rsquo;t know who Susanna H. Brown was; that is
why we came to you for information!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But where did you find the name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t know exactly; but one of our members,
in a conversation with some one who knows a lot about
literature&mdash;I forget just who it was&mdash;was told that
Susanna H. Brown had rendered noteworthy services to American
literature. We&rsquo;ve got to find out, for her name is already
printed on the programme!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what was said of Miss, or Mrs. Brown at the
meeting; but my opinion is that this particular item on the
programme had to be omitted.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page282" name="page282"></a>[pg
282]</span>Another lady entered a library abruptly and said
&ldquo;I want your books on China.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean the country of that name? or are you looking
up porcelain?&rdquo;</p>
<p>First perplexity and then dismay spread over the lady&rsquo;s
face. &ldquo;Why, I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; she faltered.
&ldquo;The program just said China!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A university professor was once asked by one of these program
committees for a list of references on German folklore&mdash;a
subject to which it had decided that its club should devote the
current season. The list, as furnished, proved rather stiff, and
the astonished professor received forthwith the following epistle
(quoted from memory):</p>
<p style="font-variant:small-caps;">&ldquo;Dear
Professor&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you so much for the folk-lore; but we have changed
our minds and have decided to study the Chicago Drainage Canal
instead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This hap-hazard method of programme-making is not confined to
club papers, as the following anecdote will show:</p>
<p>An officer of a woman&rsquo;s club entered a library and said
that she thought it would be nice to vary the usual literary
programme by the introduction of story-telling, and she asked for
aid from the library staff. It was a busy season and as the
librarian hesitated the clubwoman added hastily that the whole
programme need not occupy more than half an hour. &ldquo;We want
the very simplest things, told in a few words, so that it will
really be no trouble at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pressed to be more specific, she went on: &ldquo;Well&mdash;no
story must take more than three minutes, and we want Little Nell,
Louis IX, Moses in the Bulrushes, the Princes in the Tower,
Cinderella, Jack and the Bean Stalk, the Holy Night and Louis
XI.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page283" name="page283"></a>[pg
283]</span>&rdquo;You see that allowing three minutes apiece would
bring them all within twenty-four minutes&mdash;less than half an
hour, just as I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And&mdash;oh, yes! we want the storyteller to sit on a
platform, and just in front of her we will pose a group of little
girls, all in white frocks. Won&rsquo;t that be nice?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The making of programmes has in many cases been influenced by
the fact that some subjects are considered more
&ldquo;high-toned&rdquo; than others. The drama is at present a
particularly high-toned subject. The fine arts are always placed in
the first class. Apparently anything closely related to the
personal lives, habits and interests of those concerned is under a
ban. The fine arts, for instance, are not recognised as including
the patterns of wall-paper or curtains, or the decoration of plates
or cups. Copying from one programme to another is a common
expedient. The making of these programmes betrays, all through its
processes and their inevitable result, lack of originality, blind
adherence to models, unquestioning imitation of something that has
gone before. I do not believe these to be sex-characteristics, and
there are signs that the sex is growing out of them. If they are
not sex characteristics they must be the results of education, for
ordinary heredity would quickly equalise the sexes in this respect.
I have already stated my belief that the physical differences
between the sexes are necessarily accompanied by mental
differences, and I think it probable that the characteristics noted
above, although not proper to sex, spring from the fact that we are
expecting like results from the same educational treatment of
unlike minds. When we have learned how to vary our treatment of
these minds so as to produce like results&mdash;in those cases
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page284" name="page284"></a>[pg
284]</span>where we want the results to be alike, as in the present
instance&mdash;we shall have solved the problem of education, so
far as it affects sex-differences.</p>
<p>It has long been recognised that whenever woman does show a
deviation from standards she is apt to deviate far and erratically.
So far, however, she has shown no marked tendency so to deviate in
the arts and a very slight one in the sciences. There have been
lately some marked instances of her upward deviation in the field
of science. In literature, no age has been wanting in great woman
writers, though there have been few of them. I look eventually to
see woman physicists as eminent as Helmholtz and Kelvin, woman
painters as great as Raphael and Velasquez, woman musicians as able
as Bach and Beethoven. That we have had none yet I believe to be
solely the fault of inadequate education. Of this inadequacy our
imitative, arbitrary and uninspiring club programmes are a
part&mdash;the very fact that our clubwomen pin their faith to
programmes of any kind is a consequence of it. The substitution of
something else for these programmes, with the accompanying change
in the interests and reading of clubwomen, will be one step toward
the rationalisation of education&mdash;for all processes of this
kind are essentially educative.</p>
<p>We need not despair of finding ultimately the exact differences
in method which, applied in the education of the sexes, will
minimise such of the present mental differences as we desire to
obliterate. Problems of this sort are solved usually by the
discovery of some automatic process. In this case the key to such a
process is the fact that the mental differences between the sexes
manifest themselves in differences of interest.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page285" name="page285"></a>[pg
285]</span>Every parent of boys and girls knows that these
differences begin early to show themselves. We have been too prone
to disregard them and to substitute a set of imagined differences
that do not really exist. We go about the moral training of the boy
and the girl in precisely the same way, although their moral points
of view and susceptibilities differ in degree and kind; and then we
marvel that we do not get precisely similar moral products. But we
assume that there is some natural objection to the climbing of
trees by girls, while it is all right for boys&mdash;an imaginary
distinction that has caused tears and heart-burnings. We are
outgrowing this particular imaginary distinction, and some others
like it. Possibly we may also outgrow our systems of co-education,
so far as this means the subjection of the male and the female mind
to exactly the same processes of training. The training of the
sexes in the same institution, with its consequent mental contact
between them, has nothing to do with this, necessarily, and has
advantages that cannot be overlooked.</p>
<p>Whatever we do in school, our subsequent education, which goes
on at least as long as we inhabit this world, must be in and
through social contact, men and women together. But if each sex is
not true to itself and does not live its own life, the results
cannot be satisfactory. Reactions that are sought in an effort made
by women to conform their instincts, aspirations and mental
processes to those of men will be feeble or perverted, just as they
would be if men should seek a similar distortion. The remedy is to
let the woman&rsquo;s mind swing into the channel of least
resistance, just as the man&rsquo;s always has done. Then the
clubs, and the clubwomen, their exercises, their papers and their
preparatory reading will all be released <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page286" name="page286"></a>[pg 286]</span>from
the constraint that is now pinching them and pinning them down and
will bud and blossom and grow up to normal and valuable
fruition.</p>
<p>We have started with the fact that the reading done by the
members of women&rsquo;s clubs, especially in connection with club
papers, is often trivial, superficial, devoid of intelligence and
lacking in judgment. Treating this as a symptom; we have, I think,
traced the cause to a total lack of interest due to arbitrary,
perfunctory and unintelligent programme-making. The disease may be
diagnosed, I think, as acute programitis and the physician is in a
position to consider what therapeutic measures may be indicated. We
shall endeavor to prescribe some simple remedies.</p>
<h3>III&mdash;<em>The Remedy</em></h3>
<p>When we have once discovered the cause of a malady, we may
proceed in two ways to combat it; either we may destroy the cause
or we may render the possible victims immune. To put it a little
differently, we may eliminate either of the two elements whose
conjunction causes the disease. To grow weeds, there must co-exist
their seeds and a favourable soil. They may be exterminated either
by killing the seeds or sterilising the soil. Either of these
methods may be used in dealing with the disease that prevails among
readers, or, if you prefer the other metaphor, with the rank
vegetation that has choked the fertile soil of their minds, making
any legitimate mental crop impossible. We have seen that the
conditions favorable to the disease are a lack of interest and a
fallacious idea that there is something inherent in the printed
page <em>per se</em> that makes its perusal valuable whether the
reader is interested or not&mdash;somewhat as <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page287" name="page287"></a>[pg 287]</span>a charm
is supposed to work even when it is in a language that the user
does not understand.</p>
<p>We are considering only the form of the disease that affects
clubwomen, and this we have diagnosed as
<em>programitis</em>&mdash;the imposition of a set programme of
work&mdash;which, as an exciting cause, operates on the mental soil
prepared by indifference and fetichism to produce the malady from
which so many are now suffering.</p>
<p>I think physicians will generally agree that where the exciting
cause can be totally removed that method of dealing with the
disease is far more effective than any attempt to secure immunity.
I believe that in most cases it is so in the present instance.</p>
<p>In other words, my prescription is the abandonment, in nine
cases out of ten, of the set programme, and the substitution of
something that is interesting primarily to each individual
concerned. This is no new doctrine. Listen to William James:</p>
<blockquote>Any object not interesting in itself may become
interesting through becoming associated with an object in which an
interest already exists. The two associated objects grow, as it
were, together: the interesting portion sheds its quality over the
whole; and thus things not interesting in their own right borrow an
interest which becomes as real and as strong as that of any
natively interesting thing.... If we could recall for a moment our
whole individual history, we should see that our professional
ideals and the zeal they inspire are due to nothing but the slow
accretion of one mental object to another, traceable backward from
point to point till we reach the moment when, in the nursery or in
the schoolroom, some little story told, some little object shown,
some little operation witnessed, brought the first new object and
new interest within our ken by associating it with some one of
those primitively there. The interest now suffusing the whole
system took its rise in that little event, so insignificant to us
now as to be entirely forgotten. As the bees in swarming cling to
one another in layers till the few are reached whose feet grapple
the bough from which the swarm depends; so with the objects of our
thinking--they hang to each other by associated links, but the
original source of interest in all of them is the native interest
which the earliest one once possessed.</blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page288" name="page288"></a>[pg
288]</span> If we are to exorcise this spirit of indifference that
has settled down like a miasma upon clubdom we must find
James&rsquo;s original germ of interest&mdash;the twig upon which
our cluster of bees is ultimately to hang. Here we may introduce
two axioms: Everyone is deeply interested in something; few are
supremely interested in the same thing. I shall not attempt to
prove these, and what I shall have to say will be addressed only to
those who can accept them without proof. But I am convinced that
illustrations will occur at once to everyone. Who has not seen the
man or woman, the boy or girl who, apparently stupid, indifferent
and able to talk only in monosyllables, is suddenly shocked into
interest and volubility by the mere chance mention of some subject
of conversation&mdash;birds, or religion, or Egyptian antiquities,
or dolls, or skating, or Henry the Eighth? There are millions of
these electric buttons for galvanising dumb clay into mental and
spiritual life, and no one of them is likely to act upon more than
a very few in a given company&mdash;the theory of chances is
against it. That is why no possible programme could be made that
would fit more than a very small portion of a given club. We have
seen that many club-programmes are made with an irreducible minimum
of intelligence; but even a programme committee with superhuman
intellect and angelic goodwill could never compass the solution of
such a problem as this. Nor will it suffice to abandon the general
programme and endeavour to select for each speaker the subject that
he would like best to study and expound. No one knows what these
subjects are but the owners of the hearts that love them.</p>
<p>We have seen how the scientific and technical societies manage
the matter and how well they succeed. <span class="pagenum"><a id=
"page289" name="page289"></a>[pg 289]</span>They appoint a
committee whose duty it is to receive contributions and to select
the worthiest among those presented. The matter then takes care of
itself. These people are all interested in something. They are
finding out things by experimentation or thought; by induction or
deduction. It is the duty and the high pleasure of each to tell his
fellows of his discoveries. It is in this way that the individual
gives of his best to the race&mdash;the triumph of the social
instinct over selfishness. As this sort of intellectual
profit-sharing becomes more and more common, the reign of the
social instinct will extend and strengthen. To do one&rsquo;s part
toward such an end ought to be a pleasure, and this is one reason
why this course is commended here to the women&rsquo;s clubs.</p>
<p>Everyone, I repeat, is deeply interested in something. I am not
talking of idiots; there are no such in women&rsquo;s clubs. I have
been telling some odd stories of clubwomen, in which they are
represented as doing and saying idiotic things. These stories are
all true, and if one should take the time to collect and print
others, I do not suppose, as the sacred writer says, &ldquo;that
all the world could contain the books that should be
written.&rdquo; Things quite as idiotic as these that I have
reported are said and done in every city and every hamlet of these
United States every day in the year and every hour in the
day&mdash;except possibly between three and five A.M., and
sometimes even then. Yet those who say and do these things are not
idiots. When your friend Brown is telling you his pet anecdote for
the thirty-fifth time, or when Smith insists that you listen to a
recital of the uninteresting accomplishments of his newly-arrived
infant, you may allow your thoughts to wander and make some inane
remark, yet you are not an idiot. You are simply <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page290" name="page290"></a>[pg 290]</span>not
interested. You are using most of your mind in another direction
and it is only with what is left of it that you hear Brown or Smith
and talk to him. Brown or Smith is not dealing with your
personality as a whole, but with a residuum.</p>
<p>And this is what is the matter with the clubwomen who read
foolishly and ask foolish questions in libraries. They are residual
personalities. Not being at all interested in the matter in hand,
they are devoting to it only a minimum part of their brains; and
what they do and say is comparable with the act of the
perambulating professor, who, absorbed in mathematical calculation,
lifted his hat to the cow.</p>
<p>The professor was perhaps pardonable, for his mind was not
wandering&mdash;it was suffering, on the contrary, from excessive
concentration&mdash;but it was not concentrated on the cow. In the
case of the clubwomen, the role of the cow is played by the papers
that they are preparing, while, in lieu of the mathematical
problems, we have a variety of really absorbing subjects, more or
less important, over which their minds are wandering. What we must
do is to capture these wandering minds, and this we can accomplish
only by enlisting their own knowledge of what interests them.</p>
<p>If you would realise the difference between the mental processes
of a mere residue and those of the whole personality when its
vigour is concentrated on one subject, listen first to one of those
perfunctory essays, culled from a collection of cyclop&aelig;dias,
and then hear a whole woman throw her whole self into something.
Hear her candid opinion of some person or thing that has fallen
below her standard! Hear her able analysis of the case at law
between her family and the neighbours! Hear her make a speech on
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page291" name="page291"></a>[pg
291]</span>woman suffrage&mdash;I mean when it is really to her the
cause of causes; there are those who take it up for other reasons,
as the club-women do their papers, with not dissimilar results. In
all these cases clearness of presentation, weight of invective,
keenness of analysis spring from interest. None of these women, if
she has a feminine mind, treats these things as a man would. We men
are very apt to complain of the woman&rsquo;s mental processes, for
the same reason that narrow &ldquo;patriots&rdquo; always suspect
and deride the methods of a foreigner, simply because they are
strange and we do not understand them. But what we are compelled to
think of the results is shown by the fact that when we are truly
wise we are apt to seek the advice and counsel of the other sex and
to act upon it, even when we cannot fathom the processes by which
it was reached.</p>
<p>All the more reason this why the woman should be left to herself
and not forced to model her club paper on the mental processes of a
man, used with many necessary elisions and sometimes with very bad
workmanship, in the construction of the cyclop&aelig;dia article
never intended to be employed for any such purpose.</p>
<p>Perhaps we can never make the ordinary clubwoman talk like Susan
B. Anthony, or Anna Shaw, or Beatrice Hale, or Fola La Follette;
any more than we can put into the mouth of the ordinary business
man the words of Lincoln, or John B. Gough, or Phillips Brooks, or
Raymond Robins&mdash;but get somehow into the weakest of either sex
the impulses, the interests, the energies that once stood or now
stand behind the utterances of any one of these great Americans,
and see if the result is not something worth while! <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page292" name="page292"></a>[pg 292]</span> An
appreciative critic of the first paper in this series, writing in
<em>The Yale Alumni Weekly</em>, gives it as his opinion that these
readers are in the first stage of their education&mdash;that of
&ldquo;initial intellectual interest.&rdquo; He says:
&ldquo;Curiosity, then suspicion, come later to grow into
individual intellectual judgment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I wish I could agree that what we have diagnosed as a malady is
only an early stage of something that is ultimately to develop into
matured judgment. But the facts seem clearly to show that, far from
possessing &ldquo;initial intellectual interest,&rdquo; these
readers are practically devoid of any kind of interest whatever,
properly speaking. Such as they have is not proper to the subject,
but simply due to the fact that they desire to retain their club
membership, to fulfil their club duties, and to act in general as
other women do in other clubs. To go back to our recent simile, it
is precisely the same interest that keeps you listening, or
pretending to listen, to a bore, while you are really thinking of
something else. If you were free to follow your impulses, you would
insult the bore, or throw him downstairs, or retreat precipitately.
You are inhibited by your sense of propriety and your recognition
of what is due to a fellow-man, no matter how boresome he may be.
The clubwoman doubtless has a strong impulse to throw the
encyclop&aelig;dia out of the window, or to insult the librarian
(occasionally she does) or even to resign from the club. She is
prevented, in like manner, by her sense of propriety, and often,
too, we must admit, by a real, though rudimentary, desire for
knowledge. But such inhibitions cannot develop into judgment. They
are merely negative, while the interest that has a valuable outcome
is positive.</p>
<p>Another thing that we shall do well to remember is that no
condition or relation one of whose elements <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page293" name="page293"></a>[pg 293]</span>or
factors is the human mind can ever be properly considered apart
from that mind. Shakespeare&rsquo;s plays would seem to be fairly
unalterable. Shakespeare is dead and cannot change them, and they
have been written down in black and white this many a year. But the
real play, so far as it makes any difference to us to-day, is not
in the books; or, at least, the book is but one of its elements. It
is the effect produced upon the auditor, and of this a very
important element is the auditor&rsquo;s mental and spiritual
state. Considered from this standpoint, Shakespeare&rsquo;s plays
have been changing ever since they were written. Environment,
physical and mental, has altered; the language has developed; the
plain, ordinary talk of Shakespeare&rsquo;s time now seems to us
quaint and odd; every-day allusions have become cryptic. It all
&ldquo;ain&rsquo;t up to date,&rdquo; to quote the Cockney&rsquo;s
complaint about it. Probably no one to-day can under any
circumstances get the same reaction to a play of Shakespeare as
that of his original audience, and probably no one ever will.</p>
<p>Anecdotes possess a sort of centripetal force; tales
illustrative of the matter at hand have been flying to me from all
parts of the country. From the Pacific Northwest comes this, which
seems pertinent just here. A good clubwoman, who had been slaving
all day over a paper on Chaucer, finally at its close threw down
her pen and exclaimed, &ldquo;Oh, dear! I wish Chaucer were
<em>dead</em>!&rdquo; She had her wish in more senses than the
obvious one. Not only has Chaucer&rsquo;s physical body long ago
given up its substance to earth and air, but his works have to be
translated for most readers of the present day; his language is
fast becoming as dead as Latin or Greek. But, worse still, Ills
very spirit was dead, so far as its reaction on her was concerned.
Poetry, to you and me, is what we <span class="pagenum"><a id=
"page294" name="page294"></a>[pg 294]</span>make of it; and what do
you suppose our friend from Oregon was making of Chaucer? Our
indifference, our failure to react, is thus more far-reaching than
its influence on ourselves&mdash;it is, in some sense, a sin
against the immortal souls of those who have bequeathed their
spiritual selves to the world in books. And this sin the clubs are,
in more cases than I care to think, forcing deliberately upon their
members.</p>
<p>A well-known cartoonist toiled long in early life at some
uncongenial task for a pittance. Meanwhile he drew pictures for
fun, and one day a journalist, seeing one of his sketches, offered
him fifty dollars for it&mdash;the salary of many days. &ldquo;And
when,&rdquo; said the cartoonist, &ldquo;I found I could get more
money by playing than by working, I swore I would never work
again&mdash;and I haven&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When we can all play&mdash;do exactly what we like&mdash;and
keep ourselves and the world running by it, then the Earthly
Paradise will be achieved. But, meanwhile, cannot we realize that
these clubwomen will accomplish more if we can direct and control
their voluntary activity, backed by their whole mental energy, than
when they devote some small part of their minds to an uncongenial
task, dictated by a programme committee?</p>
<p>I shall doubtless be reminded that the larger clubs are now
generally divided into sections, and that membership in these
sections is supposed to be dictated by interest. This is a step in
the right direction, but it is an excessively short one. The
programme, with all its vicious accompaniments and lamentable
results, persists. What I have said and shall say applies as well
to an art or a domestic science section as to a club <em>in
toto</em>.</p>
<p>To bring down the treatment to a definite prescription, let us
suppose that the committee in charge <span class="pagenum"><a id=
"page295" name="page295"></a>[pg 295]</span>of a club&rsquo;s
activities, instead of marking out a definite programme for the
season, should simply announce that communications on subjects of
personal interest to the members, embodying some new and original
thought, method, idea, device, or mode of treatment, would be
received, and that the best of these would be read and discussed
before the club, after which some would appear in print. No
conditions would be stated, but it would be understood that such
features as length and style, as well as subject matter, would be
considered in selecting the papers to be read. Above all, it would
be insisted that no paper should be considered that was merely
copied from anything, either in substance or idea. It is, of
course, possible to constitute a paper almost entirely of
quotations and yet so to group and discuss these that the paper
becomes an original contribution to thought; but mere parrot-like
repetition of ascertained facts, or of other people&rsquo;s
thoughts, should not be tolerated.</p>
<p>Right here the first obstacle would be encountered. Club
members, accustomed to be assigned for study subjects like
&ldquo;The Metope of the Parthenon&rdquo; or &ldquo;The True
Significance of Hyperspace,&rdquo; will not easily comprehend that
they are really desired to put briefly on paper original ideas
about something that they know at first hand. Mrs. Jones makes
better sponge cake than any one in town; the fact is known to all
her friends. If sponge cake is a desirable product, why should not
the woman who has discovered the little knack that turns failure
into success, and who is proud of her ability and special
knowledge, tell her club of it, instead of laboriously copying from
a book&mdash;or, let us say, from two or three books&mdash;some one
else&rsquo;s compilation of the facts ascertained at second or
third hand by various other writers on &ldquo;The Character of the
Cid&rdquo;? Why should not Mrs. <span class="pagenum"><a id=
"page296" name="page296"></a>[pg 296]</span>Smith, who was out over
night in the blizzard of 1888, recount lier experiences, mental as
well as physical? Why should not Miss Robinson, who collects coins
and differs from the accepted authorities regarding the
authenticity of certain of her specimens, tell why and how and all
about it? Why should not the member who is crazy about begonias and
the one who thinks she saw Uncle Hiram&rsquo;s ghost, and she who
has read and re-read George Meredith, seeing beauties in him that
no one else ever detected&mdash;why should not one and all give
their fellows the benefit of the really valuable special knowledge
that they have acquired through years of interested thinking and
talking and doing?</p>
<p>But there will be trouble, as I have said. The thing, simple as
it is, would be too unaccustomed to comprehend. And then a real
article in a real cyclop&aelig;dia by a real writer is Information
with a big &ldquo;I.&rdquo; My little knowledge about making quince
jelly, or darning stockings, or driving an auto, or my thoughts
about the intellectual differences between Dickens and Thackeray,
or my personal theories of conduct, or my reasons for preferring
hot-water heat to steam&mdash;these are all too trivial to mention;
is it possible that you want me to write them down on paper?</p>
<p>It may thus happen that when the committee opens its mail it may
find&mdash;nothing. What, then? Logically, I should be forced to
say: Well, if none of your members is interested enough in anything
to have some original information to tell about it, disband your
club. What is the use of it? Even three newsboys, when they meet on
the street corner, begin at once to interchange ideas. Where are
yours?</p>
<p>Possibly this would be too drastic. It might be better to hold a
meeting, state the failure, and adjourn for another trial. It might
be well to repeat <span class="pagenum"><a id="page297" name=
"page297"></a>[pg 297]</span>this several times, in the hope that
the fact that absence of original ideas means no proceedings might
soak in and germinate. If this does not work, it might be possible
to fight the devil with fire, by going back to the programme method
so far as to assign definitely to members subjects in which they
are known to be deeply interested. This, in fact, is the second
method of treatment mentioned at the outset, namely, the endeavour
to secure immunity where the germ cannot be exterminated. We shall
probably never be able to rid the world of the <em>bacillus
tuberculosis</em>; the best we can do is to keep as clear of it as
we can and to strengthen our powers of resistance to it. So, if we
cannot kill the programme all at once, let us strive to make it
innocuous and to minimise its evil effects on its victims.</p>
<p>Let us suppose, now, that in one way or another, it is brought
about that every club member who reads a paper is reporting the
result of some personal experience in which her interest is
vivid&mdash;some discovery, acquisition, method, idea, criticism or
appreciation that is the product of her own life and of the
particular, personal way in which she has lived it.</p>
<p>What a result this will have on that woman&rsquo;s
reading&mdash;on what she does before she writes her paper and on
what she goes through after it! If her interest is as vivid as we
assume it to be, she will not be content to recount her own
experiences without comparing them with those of others. And after
her paper has been read and the comment and criticism of other
interested members have been brought out&mdash;of some, perhaps,
whose interest she had never before suspected, then she will feel a
fresh impulse to search for new accounts and to devour them. There
is no longer anything perfunctory about the matter. She can no
longer even trust the labour of looking up her <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page298" name="page298"></a>[pg
298]</span>references to others. She becomes an investigator; she
feels something of the joy of those who add to the sum of human
knowledge.</p>
<p>And lo! the problem of clubwomen&rsquo;s reading is solved! The
wandering mind is captured; the inane residuum is abolished by
union with the rest to form a normal, intelligent whole. No more
idiotic questions, no more cyclop&aelig;dia-copying, no more
wool-gathering programmes. Is it too much to expect? Alas, we are
but mortal!</p>
<p>I trust it has been made sufficiently clear that I think meanly
neither of the intellectual ability of women nor of the services of
women&rsquo;s clubs. The object of these papers is to give the
former an opportunity to assert itself, and the latter a chance to
profit by the assertion. The woman&rsquo;s club of the future
should be a place where original ideas, fed and directed by
interested reading, are exchanged and discussed. Were I writing of
men&rsquo;s clubs, I should point out to them the same goal. And
then, perhaps, we may look forward to a time when a selected group
of men and women may come together and talk of things in which they
both, as men and women, are interested.</p>
<p>When this happens, I trust that in the discussion we shall not
heed the advice of some modern feminists and forget that we are as
God made us. Why should each man talk to a woman &ldquo;as if she
were another man&rdquo;? I never heard it advised that each woman
should talk to each man &ldquo;as if he were another woman&rdquo;;
but I should resent it if I did. Why shut our eyes to the truth? I
trust that I have not been talking to the club-women &ldquo;as if
they were men&rdquo;; I am sure I have not meant to do so. They are
not men; they have their own ways, and those ways should be
developed and encouraged. We have had the psychology of race, of
the crowd and of the criminal; <span class="pagenum"><a id=
"page299" name="page299"></a>[pg 299]</span>where is the
investigator who has studied the Psychology of Woman? When she
(note the pronoun) has arrived, let us make her president of a
woman&rsquo;s club.</p>
<p>It is with diffidence that I have outlined any definite
procedure, because, after all, the precise manner in which the
treatment should be applied will depend, of course, on the club
concerned. To prescribe for you most effectively, your physician
should be an intimate friend. He should have known you from
birth&mdash;better still, he should have cared for your father and
your grandfather before you. Otherwise, he prescribes for an
average man; and you may be very far from the average. The drug
that he administers to quiet your nerves may act on your heart and
give you the smothers&mdash;it might conceivably quiet you
permanently. Then the doctor would send to his medical journal a
note on &ldquo;A Curious Case of Umptiol Poisoning,&rdquo; but you
would still be dead, even if all his readers should agree with
him.</p>
<p>I have no desire to bring about casualties of this kind. Let
those who know and love each particular club devote themselves to
the task of applying my treatment to it in a way that will involve
a minimum shock to its nerves and a minimum amount of interference
with its metabolic processes. It will take time. Rome was not built
in a day, and a revolution in clubdom is not going to be
accomplished over night.</p>
<p>I have prescribed simple remedies&mdash;too simple, I am
convinced, to be readily adopted. What could be simpler than to
advise the extermination of all germ diseases by killing off the
germs? Any physician will tell you that this method is the very
acme of efficiency; yet, the germs are still with us, and bid fair
to spread suffering and death over our planet for many a long year
to come. So I am not sanguine that we <span class="pagenum"><a id=
"page300" name="page300"></a>[pg 300]</span>shall be able all at
once to kill off the programmes. All that may be expected is that
at some distant day the simplicity and effectiveness of some plan
of the sort will begin to commend itself to clubwomen. If, then,
some lover of the older literature will point out the fact that,
back in 1915, the gloomy era when fighting hordes were spreading
blood and carnage over the fair face of Europe, an obscure and
humble librarian, in the pages of <span style=
"font-variant:small-caps;">The Bookman</span>, pointed out the way
to sanity, I shall be well content.</p>

<h2><a name="Essay23" id="Essay23">Books For Tired Eyes</a></h2>
<p class="returnTOC"><a href="#Contents">Return to Table of
Contents</a></p>
<p>The most distinctive thing about a book is the possibility that
someone may read it. Is this a truism? Evidently not; for the
publishers, who print books, and the libraries, which store and
distribute them, have never thought it worth their while to collect
and record information bearing on this possibility. In the
publisher&rsquo;s or the bookseller&rsquo;s advertising
announcements, as well as on the catalogue cards stored in the
library&rsquo;s trays, the reader may ascertain when and where the
book was published, the number of pages, and whether it contains
plates or maps; but not a word of the size or style of type in
which it is printed. Yet on this depends the ability of the reader
to use the book for the purpose for which it was intended. The
old-fashioned reader was a mild-mannered gentleman. If he could not
read his book because it was printed in outrageously small type, he
laid it aside with a sigh, or used a magnifying lens, or persisted
in his attempts with the naked eye until eyestrain, with its
attendant maladies, was the result. Lately however, the libraries
have been waking up, and their readers with them. The utilitarian
side of the work is pushed to the front; and the reader is by no
means disposed to accept what may be offered him, either in the
content of the book or its physical make-up. The modern library
must adapt itself to its users, and among other improvements must
come an attempt to go as far as possible in making books
physiologically readable.</p>
<p>Unfortunately the library cannot control the output of books,
and must limit itself to selection. An <span class="pagenum"><a id=
"page302" name="page302"></a>[pg 302]</span>experiment in such
selection is now in progress in the St. Louis Public Library. The
visitor to that library will find in its Open Shelf Room a section
of shelving marked with the words &ldquo;Books in large
type.&rdquo; To this section are directed all readers who have
found it difficult or painful to read the ordinary printed page but
who do not desire to wear magnifying lenses. It has not been easy
to fill these shelves, for books in large type are few, and hard to
secure, despite the fact that artists, printers, and oculists have
for years been discussing the proper size, form, and grouping of
printed letters from their various standpoints. Perhaps it is time
to urge a new view&mdash;that of the public librarian, anxious to
please his clients and to present literature to them in that
physical form which is most easily assimilable and least
harmful.</p>
<p>Tired eyes belong, for the most part, to those who have worked
them hardest; that is, to readers who have entered upon middle age
or have already passed through it. At this age we become conscious
that the eye is a delicate instrument&mdash;a fact which, however
familiar to us in theory, has previously been regarded with
aloofness. Now it comes home to us. The length of a sitting, the
quality, quantity, and incidence of the light, and above all, the
arrangement of the printed page, become matters of vital importance
to us. A book with small print, or letters illegibly grouped, or of
unrecognizable shapes, becomes as impossible to us as if it were
printed in the Chinese character.</p>
<p>It is an unfortunate law of nature that injurious acts appear to
us in their true light only after the harm is done. The burnt child
dreads the fire after he has been burned&mdash;not before. So the
fact that the middle-aged man cannot read small, or crooked, or
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page303" name="page303"></a>[pg
303]</span>badly grouped type means simply that the harmfulness of
these things, which always existed for him, has cumulated
throughout a long tale of years until it has obtruded itself upon
him in the form of an inhibition. The books that are imperative for
the tired eyes of middle age, are equally necessary for those of
youth&mdash;did youth but know it. Curiously enough, we are
accustomed to begin, in teaching the young to read, with very
legible type. When the eyes grow stronger, we begin to maltreat
them. So it is, also, with the digestive organs, which we first
coddle with pap, then treat awhile with pork and cocktails, and
then, perforce, entertain with pap of the second and final period.
What correspond, in the field of vision, to pork and cocktails, are
the vicious specimens of typography offered on all sides to
readers&mdash;in books, pamphlets, magazines, and
newspapers&mdash;typography that is slowly but surely ruining the
eyesight of those that need it most.</p>
<p>Hitherto, the public librarian has been more concerned with the
minds and the morals of his clientele than with that physical
organism without which neither mind nor morals would be of much
use. It would be easy to pick out on the shelves of almost any
public library books that are a physiological scandal, printed in
type that it is an outrage to place before any self-respecting
reader. I have seen copies of &ldquo;Tom Jones&rdquo; that I should
be willing to burn, as did a puritanical British library-board of
newspaper notoriety. My reasons, however, would be typographic, not
moral, and I might want to add a few copies of &ldquo;The
Pilgrim&rsquo;s Progress&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Saint&rsquo;s
Everlasting Rest,&rdquo; without prejudice to the authors&rsquo;
share in those works, which I admire and respect. Perhaps it is too
much to ask for complete typographical expurgation of our
libraries. But, at least, readers with <span class="pagenum"><a id=
"page304" name="page304"></a>[pg 304]</span>tired eyes who do not
yet wear, or care to wear, corrective lenses, should be able to
find, somewhere on the shelves, a collection of works in relatively
harmless print&mdash;large and black, clear in outline, simple and
distinctive in form, properly grouped and spaced.</p>
<p>The various attempts to standardize type-sizes and to adopt a
suitable notation for them have been limited hitherto to the sizes
of the type-body and bear only indirectly on the size of the actual
letter. More or less arbitrary names&mdash;such as minion,
bourgeois, brevier, and nonpareil,&mdash;were formerly used; but
what is called the point-system is now practically universal,
although its unit, the &ldquo;point,&rdquo; is not everywhere the
same. Roughly speaking, a point is one-seventy-second of an inch,
so that in three-point type, for example, the thickness of the
type-body, from the top to the bottom of the letter on its face, is
one-twenty-fourth of an inch. But on this type-body the face may be
large or small&mdash;although of course, it cannot be larger than
the body,&mdash;and the size of the letters called by precisely the
same name in the point notation may vary within pretty wide limits.
There is no accepted notation for the size of the letters
themselves, and this fact tells, more eloquently than words, that
the present sizes of type are standardized and defined for
compositors only, not for readers, and still less for scientific
students of the effect upon the readers&rsquo; eyes of different
arrangements of the printed page.</p>
<p>What seems to have been the first attempt to define sizes of
type suitable for school grades was made fifteen years ago by Mr
Edward R. Shaw in his &ldquo;School Hygiene&rdquo;; he advocates
sizes from eighteen-point in the first year to twelve-point for the
fourth. &ldquo;Principals, teachers, and school
superintendents,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;should possess a millimetre
measure and a <span class="pagenum"><a id="page305" name=
"page305"></a>[pg 305]</span>magnifying glass, and should subject
every book presented for their examination to a test to determine
whether the size of the letters and the width of the leading are of
such dimensions as will not prove injurious to the eyes of
children.&rdquo; To this list, librarians might be well
added&mdash;not to speak of authors, editors, and publishers. In a
subsequent part of his chapter on &ldquo;Eyesight and
Hearing,&rdquo; from which the above sentence is quoted, appears a
test of illumination suggested by &ldquo;The Medical Record&rdquo;
of Strasburg, which may serve as a &ldquo;horrid example&rdquo; in
some such way as did the drunken brother who accompanied the
temperance lecturer. According to this authority, if a pupil is
unable to read diamond
type&mdash;four-and-one-half-point&mdash;&ldquo;at twelve-inch
distance and without strain,&rdquo; the illumination is dangerously
low. The adult who tries the experiment will be inclined to
conclude that whatever the illumination, the proper place for the
man who uses diamond type for any purpose is the penitentiary.</p>
<p>The literature upon this general subject, such as it is, is
concerned largely with its relations with school hygiene. We are
bound to give our children a fair start in life, in conditions of
vision as well as in other respects, even if we are careless about
ourselves. The topic of &ldquo;Conservation of Vision,&rdquo; in
which, however, type-size played but a small part, was given
special attention at the Fourth International Congress of School
Hygiene, held in Buffalo in 1913. Investigations on the subject, so
far as they affect the child in school, are well summed up in the
last chapter of Huey&rsquo;s &ldquo;Psychology and Pedagogy of
Reading.&rdquo; In general, the consensus of opinion of
investigators seems to be that the most legible type is that
between eleven-point and fourteen-point. Opinion regarding space
between lines, due to &ldquo;leading,&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page306" name="page306"></a>[pg 306]</span>is not
quite so harmonious. Some authorities think that it is better to
increase the size of the letters; and Huey asserts that an attempt
to improve unduly small type by making wide spaces between lines is
a mistake.</p>
<p>As to the relative legibility of different type-faces, one of
the most exhaustive investigations was that made at Clark
University by Miss Barbara E. Roethlin, whose results were
published in 1912. This study considers questions of form, style,
and grouping, independently of mere size; and the conclusion is
that legibility is a product of six factors, of which size is one,
the others being form, heaviness of face, width of the margin
around the letter, position in the letter-group, and shape and size
of adjoining letters. For &ldquo;tired eyes&rdquo; the size factor
would appear of overwhelming importance except where the other
elements make the page fantastically illegible. In Miss
Roethlin&rsquo;s tables, based upon a combination of the factors
mentioned above, the maximum of legibility almost always coincides
with that of size. These experiments seem to have influenced
printers, whose organization in Boston has appointed a committee to
urge upon the Carnegie Institution the establishment of a
department of research to make scientific tests of printing-types
in regard to the comparative legibility and the possibility of
improving some of their forms. Their effort, so far, has met with
no success; but the funds at the disposal of this body could surely
be put to no better use.</p>
<p>With regard to the improvement of legibility by alteration of
form, it has been recognized by experiments from the outset that
the letters of our alphabet, especially the small, or
&ldquo;lower-case&rdquo; letters, are not equally legible. Many
proposals for modifying or changing them have been made, some of
them odd <span class="pagenum"><a id="page307" name=
"page307"></a>[pg 307]</span>or repugnant. It has been suggested,
for instance, that the Greek lambda be substituted for our
<em>l</em>, which in its present form is easily confused with the
dotted <em>i</em>. Other pairs of letters (<em>u</em> and
<em>n</em>, <em>o</em> and <em>e</em>, for example) are
differentiated with difficulty. The privilege of modifying
alphabetic form is one that has been frequently exercised. The
origin of the German alphabet and our own, for instance, is the
same, and no lower-case letters in any form date further back than
the Middle Ages. There could be no well-founded objection to any
change, in the interests of legibility, that is not so far-reaching
as to make the whole alphabet look foreign and unfamiliar. It may
be queried, however, whether the lower-case alphabet had not better
be reformed by abolishing it altogether. There would appear to be
no good reason for using two alphabets, now one and now the other,
according to arbitrary rules, difficult to learn and hard to
remember. That the general legibility of books would benefit by
doing away with this mediaeval excrescence appears to admit of no
doubt, although the proposal may seem somewhat startling to the
general reader.</p>
<p>In 1911, a committee was appointed by the British Association
for the Advancement of Science &ldquo;to inquire into the influence
of school-books upon eyesight.&rdquo; This committee&rsquo;s report
dwells on the fact that the child&rsquo;s eye is still in process
of development and needs larger type than the fully developed eye
of the adult. In making its recommendation for the standardization
of school-book type, which it considers the solution of the
difficulty, the committee emphasizes the fact that forms and sizes
most legible for isolated letters are not necessarily so for the
groups that need to be quickly recognized by the trained reader. It
dwells upon the importance of <span class="pagenum"><a id="page308"
name="page308"></a>[pg 308]</span>unglazed paper, flexible sewing,
clear, bold illustrations, black ink, and true alignment. Condensed
or compressed letters are condemned, as are long serifs and hair
strokes. On the other hand, very heavy-faced type is almost as
objectionable as that with the fine lines, the ideal being a proper
balancing of whites and blacks in each letter and group. The size
of the type face, as we might expect, is pronounced by the
committee &ldquo;the most important factor in the influence of
books upon vision&rdquo;; it describes its recommended sizes in
millimetres&mdash;a refinement which, for the purposes of this
article, need not be insisted upon. Briefly, the sizes run from
thirty-point, for seven-year-old children, to ten-point or
eleven-point, for persons more than twelve years old. Except as an
inference from this last recommendation, the committee, of course,
does not exceed its province by treating of type-sizes for adults;
yet it would seem that it considers ten-point as the smallest size
fit for anyone, however good his sight. This would bar much of our
existing reading matter.</p>
<p>A writer whose efforts in behalf of sane typography have had
practical results is Professor Koopman, librarian of Brown
University, whose plea has been addressed chiefly to printers.
Professor Koopman dwells particularly on the influence of short
lines on legibility. The eye must jump from the end of each line
back to the beginning of the next, and this jump is shorter and
less fatiguing with the shorter line, though it must be oftener
performed. Owing largely to his demonstration, &ldquo;The Printing
Art,&rdquo; a trade magazine published in Cambridge, Massachusetts,
has changed its make-up from a one-column to a two-column page. It
should be noted, however, that a uniform, standard length of line
is even more to be desired than a short one. When the <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page309" name="page309"></a>[pg 309]</span>eye has
become accustomed to one length for its linear leaps, these leaps
can be performed with relative ease and can be taken care of
subconsciously. When the lengths vary capriciously from one book,
or magazine, to another, or even from one page to another, as they
so often do, the effort to get accustomed to the new length is more
tiring than we realize. Probably this factor, next to the size of
type, is most effective in tiring the middle-aged eye, and in
keeping it tired. The opinion may be ventured that the reason for
our continued toleration of the small type used in the daily
newspapers is that their columns are narrow, and still more, that
these are everywhere of practically uniform width.</p>
<p>The indifference of publishers to the important feature of the
physical make-up of books appears from the fact that in not a
single case is it included among the descriptive items in their
catalogue entries. Libraries are in precisely the same class of
offenders. A reader or a possible purchaser of books is supposed to
be interested in the fact that a book is published in Boston, has
four hundred and thirty-two pages, and is illustrated, but not at
all in its legibility. Neither publishers nor libraries have any
way of getting information on the subject, except by going to the
books themselves. Occasionally a remainder-catalogue, containing
bargains whose charms it is desired to set forth with unusual
detail, states that a certain book is in &ldquo;large type,&rdquo;
or even in &ldquo;fine, large type,&rdquo; but these words are
nowhere defined, and the purchaser cannot depend on their accuracy.
An edition of Scott, recently advertised extensively as in
&ldquo;large, clear type,&rdquo; proved on examination to be
printed in ten-point.</p>
<p>In gathering the large-type collection for the St. Louis Library
fourteen-point was decided upon as the <span class="pagenum"><a id=
"page310" name="page310"></a>[pg 310]</span>standard, which means,
of course, types with a face somewhere between the smallest size
that is usually found on a fourteen-point body, even if actually on
a smaller body, and the largest that this can carry, even if on a
larger body. The latter is unusually large, but it would not do to
place the standard below fourteen-point, because that would lower
the minimum, which is none too large as it is. The first effort was
to collect such large-type books, already in the library, as would
be likely to interest the general reader. In the collection of
nearly 400,000 volumes, it was found by diligent search that only
150 would answer this description. Most octavo volumes of travel
are in large type, but only a selected number of these was placed
in the collection to avoid overloading it with this particular
class. This statement applies also to some other classes, and to
certain types of books, such as some government reports and some
scientific monographs, which have no representatives in the group.
The next step was to supplement the collection by purchase. All
available publishers&rsquo; catalogues were examined, but after a
period of twelve months it was found possible to spend only $65.00
in the purchase of 120 additional books. A circular letter was then
sent to ninety-two publishers, explaining the purpose of the
collection and asking for information regarding books in
fourteen-point type, or larger, issued by them. To these there were
received sixty-three answers. In twenty-nine instances, no books in
type of this size were issued by the recipients of the circulars.
In six cases, the answer included brief lists of from two to twelve
titles of large-type books; and in several other cases, the
publishers stated that the labor of ascertaining which of their
publications are in large type would be prohibitive, as it would
involve actual inspection of each and every volume on their lists.
In two instances, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page311" name=
"page311"></a>[pg 311]</span>however, after a second letter,
explaining further the aims of the collection, publishers promised
to undertake the work. The final result has been that the Library
now has over four hundred volumes in the collection. This is surely
not an imposing number, but it appears to represent the available
resources of a country in which 1,000 publishers are annually
issuing 11,000 volumes&mdash;to say nothing of the British and
Continental output. In the list of the collection and in the
entries, the size of the type, the leading, and the size of the
book itself are to be distinctly stated. The last-mentioned item is
necessary because the use of large type sometimes involves a heavy
volume, awkward to hold in the hand. The collection for adults in
the St. Louis Library, as it now exists, may be divided into the
following classes, according to the reasons that seem to have
prompted the use of large type:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p class="noindent">Large books printed on a somewhat generous
scale and intended to sell at a high price, the size of the type
being merely incidental to this plan. These include books of
travel, history, or biography in several volumes, somewhat
high-priced sets of standard authors, and books intended for
gifts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="noindent">Books containing so little material that large
type, thick paper, and wide margins were necessary to make a volume
easy to handle and use. These include many short stories of
magazine length, which for some inscrutable reason are now often
issued in separate form.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="noindent">Books printed in large type for aesthetic
reasons. These are few, beauty and artistic form being apparently
linked in some way with illegibility by many printers, no matter
what the size of the type-face.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The large-type collection is used, not only by <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page312" name="page312"></a>[pg 312]</span>elderly
persons, but also in greater number by young persons whose oculists
forbid them to read fine print, or who do not desire to wear
glasses. The absence of a wide range in the collection drives
others away to books that are, doubtless, in many cases bad for
their eyes. Some books that have not been popular in the general
collection have done well here, while old favorites have not been
taken out. Such facts as these mean little with so limited a
collection. Until readers awake to the dangers of small print and
the comfort of large type there will not be sufficient pressure on
our publishers to induce them to put forth more books suitable for
tired eyes. It is probably too much to expect that the trade itself
will try to push literature whose printed form obeys the rules of
ocular hygiene. All that we can reasonably ask is that type-size
shall be reported on in catalogues, so that those who want books in
large type may know what is obtainable and where to go for it.</p>
<p>It has often been noted that physicians are the only class of
professional men whose activities, if properly carried on, tend
directly to make the profession unnecessary. Medicine tends more
and more to be preventive rather than curative. We must therefore
look to the oculists to take the first steps towards lessening the
number of their prospective patients by inculcating rational
notions about the effects of the printed page on the eye. Teachers,
librarians, parents, the press&mdash;all can do their part. And
when a demand for larger print has thus been created the trade will
respond. Meanwhile, libraries should be unremitting in their
efforts to ascertain what material in large type already exists, to
collect it, and to call attention to it in every legitimate
way.</p>

<p>Anyone who talks or writes about the &ldquo;movies&rdquo; is
likely to be misunderstood. There is little to be said now about
the moving picture as a moving picture, unless one wants to discuss
its optics or mechanics. The time is past when anyone went to see a
moving picture as a curiosity. It was once the eighth wonder of the
world; it long ago abdicated that position to join its dispossessed
brothers the telephone, the X-ray, the wireless telegraph and the
phonograph. What we now go to see is not the moving picture, but
what the moving picture shows us; it is no more than a window
through which we gaze&mdash;the poet&rsquo;s &ldquo;magic
casement&rdquo; opening (sometimes) &ldquo;on the foam of perilous
seas.&rdquo; We may no more praise or condemn the moving picture
for what it shows us than we may praise or condemn a proscenium
arch or the glass in a show window.</p>
<p>The critic who thinks that the movies are lowering our tastes,
or doing anything else objectionable, as well as he who thinks they
are educating the masses, is not of the opinion that the moving
pictures are doing these things because they show moving objects on
a screen, but because of the character of what is photographed for
such exhibition.</p>
<p>Thoughts on the movies, therefore, must be rather thoughts on
things that are currently shown us by means of the movies; thoughts
also on some of the things that we might see and do not. I have
compared the screen above to a proscenium arch and a <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page314" name="page314"></a>[pg 314]</span>show
window, but both of these are selective: the screen is as broad as
the world. It is especially adapted to show realities; through it
one may see the coast of Dalmatia as viewed from a steamer, the
habits of animals in the African jungle, or the play of emotion on
the faces of an audience at a ball game in Philadelphia. I am
pleased to see that more and more of these interesting realities
are shown daily in the movie theatres. There has been a determined
effort to make them unpopular by calling them
&ldquo;educational,&rdquo; but they seem likely to outlive it. One
is educated, of course, by everything that he sees or does, but why
rub it in? The boy who thoroughly likes to go sailing will get more
out of it than he who goes because he thinks it will be &ldquo;an
educational experience.&rdquo; As one who goes to the movies I
confess that I enjoy its realities. Probably they educate me, and I
take that with due meekness. Some of these realities I enjoy
because they are unfamiliar, like the boiling of the lava lake in
the Hawaiian craters and the changing crowds in the streets of
Manila; some because they are familiar, like a college foot-ball
game or the movement of vessels in the North River at New York.</p>
<p>I like the realities, too, in the dramatic performances that
still occupy and probably will continue to occupy, most of the time
at a movie theatre. Here I come into conflict with the producer.
Like every other adapter he can not cut loose from the old when he
essays the new. We no longer wear swords, but we still carry the
buttons for the sword belt, and it is only recently that
semi-tropic Americans gave up the dress of north-temperate Europe.
So the movie producer can not forget the theatre. Now the theatre
has some advantages that the movie can never attain&mdash;notably
the use of speech. The movie, on the other <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page315" name="page315"></a>[pg 315]</span>hand,
has unlimited freedom of scene and the use of real backgrounds. We
do not object to a certain amount of what we call
&ldquo;staginess&rdquo; on the stage&mdash;it is a part of its art;
as the pigment is part of that of the painter. We are surrounded by
symbols; we are not surprised that costume, gesture and voice are
also symbolic instead of purely natural. But in the moving picture
play it is, or should be, different. The costume and make-up, the
posture and gesture, that seem appropriate in front of a painted
house or tree on a back-drop, become so out-of-place as to be
repulsive when one sees them in front of a real house and real
trees, branches moving in the wind, running water&mdash;all the
familiar accompaniments of nature. The movie producers, being
unable to get away from their stage experience, are failing to
grasp their opportunity. Instead of creating a drama of reality to
correspond with the real environment that only the movie can offer,
they are abandoning the unique advantages of that environment, to a
large degree. They build fake cities, they set all their interiors
in fake studio rooms, where everything is imitation; even when they
let us see a bit of outdoors, it is not what it pretends to be. We
have all seen, on the screen, bluffs 200 feet high on the coast of
Virginia and palm trees growing in the borough of the Bronx. And
they hire stage actors to interpret the stagiest of stage plots in
as stagy a way as they know how. I am taking the movie seriously
because I like it and because I see that I share that liking with a
vast throng of persons with whom it is probably the only thing I
have in common&mdash;persons separated from me by differences of
training and education that would seem to make a common ground of
any kind well-nigh impossible. With some persons the fact that the
movie is democratic puts it outside the pale at once. Nothing,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page316" name="page316"></a>[pg
316]</span>in their estimation, is worth discussing unless
appreciation of it is limited to the few. Their attitude is that of
the mother who said to the nurse: &ldquo;Go and see what baby is
doing, and tell him he musn&rsquo;t.&rdquo; &ldquo;Let us,&rdquo;
they say &ldquo;find out what people like, and then try to make
them like something else.&rdquo; To such I have nothing to say. We
ought rather, I believe, to find out the kind of thing that people
like and then do our best to see that they get it in the best
quality&mdash;that it is used in every way possible to pull them
out of the mud, instead of rubbing their noses further in.</p>
<p>On the other hand, some capable critics, like Mr. Walter
Pritchard Eaton, decry the movies because they are
undemocratic&mdash;because they are offering a form of
entertainment appealing only to the uneducated and thus segregating
them from the educated, who presumably all attend the regular
theatre, sitting in the parquet at two dollars per. One wonders
whether Mr. Eaton has attended a moving-picture theatre since 1903.
I believe the movie to be by all odds the most democratic form of
intellectual (by which I mean non-physical) entertainment ever
offered; and I base my belief on wide observation of audiences in
theatres of many different grades. Now this democracy shows itself
not only in the composition of audiences but in their
manifestations of approval. I do not mean that everyone in an
audience always likes the same thing. Some outrageous
&ldquo;slap-stick&rdquo; comedy rejoices one and offends another. A
particularly foolish plot may satisfy in one place while it bores
in another. But everywhere I find one thing that appeals to
everybody&mdash;realism. Just as soon as there appears on the
screen something that does not know how to pose and is forced by
nature to be natural&mdash;an animal or a young child, for
instance&mdash;there are immediate manifestations of interest and
delight.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page317" name="page317"></a>[pg
317]</span>The least &ldquo;stagy&rdquo; actors are almost always
favorites. Mary Pickford stands at the head. There is not an ounce
of staginess in her make-up. She was never particularly successful
on the stage. Some of her work seems to me ideal acting for the
screen&mdash;simple, appealing, absolutely true. Of course she is
not always at her best.</p>
<p>To the stage illusions that depend on costume and make-up, the
screen is particularly unfriendly. Especially in the
&ldquo;close-ups&rdquo; the effect is similar to that which one
would have if he were standing close to the actor looking directly
into his face. It is useless to depend on ordinary make-up under
these circumstances. Either it should be of the description used by
Sherlock Holmes and other celebrated detectives (we rely on
hearsay) which deceives the very elect at close quarters, or else
the producer must choose for his characters those that naturally
&ldquo;look the parts.&rdquo; In particular, the lady who, although
long past forty, continues to play <em>ingenue</em> parts and
&ldquo;gets away with it&rdquo; on the stage, must get away
<em>from</em> it, when it comes to the screen. The &ldquo;close
up&rdquo; tells the sad story at once. The part of a
sixteen-year-old girl must be played by a real one. Another
concession to realism, you see. And what is true of persons is true
of their environment. I have already registered my disapproval of
the &ldquo;Universal City&rdquo; type of production. It is almost
as easy for the expert to pick out the fake Russian village or the
pasteboard Virginia court-house as it is for him to spot the
wrinkles in the countenance of the school girl who left school in
1892. Next to a fake environment the patchwork scene enrages
one&mdash;the railway that is double-track with 90-pound rails in
one scene and single-track with streaks of rust in the next; the
train that is hauled in quick succession by locomotives of the
Mogul type, the Atlantic and the wood-burning vintage of 1868.
There <span class="pagenum"><a id="page318" name="page318"></a>[pg
318]</span>is here an impudent assumption in the producer, of a
lack of intelligence in his audience, that is quite maddening. The
same lack of correspondence appears between different parts of the
same street, and between the outside and inside of houses. I am
told by friends that I am quite unreasonable in the extent to which
I carry my demands for realism in the movies. &ldquo;What would you
have?&rdquo; they ask. I would have a producing company that should
advertise, &ldquo;We have no studio&rdquo; and use only real
backgrounds&mdash;the actual localities represented. &ldquo;Do you
mean to tell me,&rdquo; my friend goes on, &ldquo;that you would
carry your company to Spain whenever the scene of their play is
laid in that country? The expense would be prohibitive.&rdquo; I
most certainly should not, and this because of the very realism
that I am advocating. Plays laid in Spain should be acted not only
in Spain but by Spaniards. The most objectionable kind of fake is
that in which Americans are made to do duty for Spaniards, Hindus
or Japanese when their appearance, action and bearing clearly
indicate that they were born and brought up in Skowhegan, Maine or
Crawfordsville, Indiana. I have seen Mary Pickford in &ldquo;Madame
Butterfly&rdquo;, and I testify sadly that not even she can succeed
here. No; if we want Spanish plays let us use those made on Spanish
soil. Let us have free interchange of films between all
film-producing countries. All the change required would be
translating the captions, or better still, plays might be produced
that require no captions. This might mean the total reorganization
of the movie-play business in this country&mdash;a revolution which
I should view with equanimity. Speaking of captions, here again the
average producer appears to agree with Walter Pritchard Eaton that
he is catering only to the uneducated. The writers of most captions
seem, indeed, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page319" name=
"page319"></a>[pg 319]</span>to have abandoned formal instruction
in the primary school. Why should not a movie caption be good
literature? Some of them are. The Cabiria captions were fine:
though I do not admire that masterpiece. I am told that
D&rsquo;Annunzio composed them with care, and equal care was
evidently used in the translation. The captions of the George Ade
fables are uniformly good, and there are other notable exceptions.
Other places where knowledge of language is required are
inadequately taken care of. Letters from eminent persons make one
want to hide under the chairs. These persons usually sign
themselves &ldquo;Duke of Gandolfo&rdquo; or &ldquo;Secretary of
State Smith.&rdquo; Are grammar school graduates difficult to get,
or high-priced? I beg you to observe that here again lack of
realism is my objection.</p>
<p>But divers friends interpose the remark that the movies are
already too realistic. &ldquo;They leave nothing to the
imagination.&rdquo; If this were so, it were a grievous
fault&mdash;at any rate in so far as the moving-picture play aims
at being an art-form. All good art leaves something to the
imagination. As a matter of fact, however, the movie is the exact
complement of the spoken play as read from a book. Here we have the
words in full, the scene and action being left to the imagination
except as briefly sketched in the stage direction. In the movie we
have scene and action in full, the words being left to the
imagination except as briefly indicated in the captions. Where
captions are very full the form may perhaps be said to be
complementary to the novel, where besides the words we are given a
written description of scene and action that is often full of
detail. The movie leaves just as much to the imagination as the
novel, but what is so left is different in the two cases. Do I
think that everyone in a movie audience makes use of his privilege
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page320" name="page320"></a>[pg
320]</span>to imagine what the actors are saying? No; neither does
the novel-reader always image the scene and action. This does not
depend on ignorance or the reverse, but on imaging power.
Exceptional visual and auditive imaging power are rarely present in
the same individual. I happen to have the former. I automatically
see everything of which I read in a novel, and when the
descriptions are not detailed, this gets me into trouble. On a
second reading my imaged background may be different and when the
earlier one asserts itself there is a conflict that I can compare
only to hearing two tunes played at once. Persons having already
good visual imaging power should develop their auditive imaging
power by going to the movies and hearing what the actors say; these
with deficient visual imagery should read novels and see the
scenery. But to say that the movies allow no scope for the
imagination is absurd. As I said at the outset, the movie play is
just a play seen through the medium of a moving picture. It is like
seeing a drama near enough to note the slightest play of feature
and at the same time so far away that the actors can not be
heard&mdash;somewhat like seeing a distant play through a fine
telescope. The action should therefore differ in no respect from
what would be proper if the words were intended to be heard.
Doubtless this imposes a special duty upon both the author of the
scenario and the producer, and they do not always respond to it.
Action is introduced that fails to be intelligible without the
words, and to clear it up the actors are made to use pantomime.
Pantomime is an interesting and valuable form of dramatic art, but
it is essentially symbolic and stagy and has, I believe, no place
in the moving picture play as we have developed it. If owing to the
faulty construction of the play, or a lack of skill on the part of
producer <span class="pagenum"><a id="page321" name=
"page321"></a>[pg 321]</span>or actors, all sorts of gestures and
grimaces become necessary that would not be required if the words
were heard, the production can not be considered good. Sometimes,
of course, words are <em>seen</em>; though not heard. The story of
the deaf mutes who read the lips of the movie actors, and detected
remarks not at all in consonance with the action of the play, is
doubtless familiar. It crops up in various places and is as
ubiquitous as Washington&rsquo;s Headquarters. It is good enough to
be true, but I have never run it to earth yet. Even those of us who
are not deaf-mutes, however, may detect an exclamation now and then
and it gives great force to the action, though I doubt whether it
is quite legitimate in a purely picture-play.</p>
<p>I beg leave to doubt whether realism is fostered by a method of
production said to be in vogue among first rate producers; namely
keeping actors in ignorance of the play and directing the action as
it goes on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come in now, Mr. Smith; sit in that chair; cross your
legs; light a cigar; register perplexity; you hear a sound; jump to
your feet&rdquo;&mdash;and so on. This may save the producer
trouble, but it reduces the actors to marionettes; it is not thus
that masterpieces are turned out.</p>
<p>Is there any chance of a movie masterpiece, anyway? Yes, but not
in the direction that most producers see it. What Vachell Lindsay
calls &ldquo;Splendor&rdquo; in the movies is an interesting and
striking feature of them&mdash;the moving of masses of people amid
great architectural construction&mdash;sieges, triumphs, battles,
mobs&mdash;but all this is akin to scenery. Its movements are like
those of the trees or the surf. One can not make a play entirely of
scenery, though the contrary seems to be the view of some
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page322" name="page322"></a>[pg
322]</span>managers, even on the stage of the regular theatre. So
far, the individual acting and plot construction in the great
spectacular movies has been poor. It was notably so, it seems to me
in the Birth of a Nation and not much better in Cabiria. Judith of
Bethulia (after T.B. Aldrich) is the best acted
&ldquo;splendor&rdquo; play that I have seen. Masterpieces are
coming not through spending millions on supes, and
&ldquo;real&rdquo; temples, and forts; but rather by writing a
scenario particularly adapted to film-production, hiring and
training actors that know how to act for the camera, preferably
those without bad stage habits to unlearn, cutting out all unreal
scenery, costume and make-up and keeping everything as simple and
as close to the actual as possible. The best movie play I ever saw
was in a ten-cent theatre in St. Louis. It was a dramatization of
Frank Norris&rsquo;s &ldquo;McTeague.&rdquo; I have never seen it
advertised anywhere, and I never heard of the actors, before or
since. But most of it was fine, sincere work, and seeing it made me
feel that there is a future for the movie play.</p>
<p>One trouble is that up to date, neither producers nor actors nor
the most intelligent and best educated part of the audience take
the movies seriously. Here is one of the marvels of modern times;
something that has captured the public as it never was captured
before. And yet most of us look at it as a huge joke, or as
something intended to entertain the populace, at which we, too are
graciously pleased to be amused. It might mend matters if we could
have every day in some reputable paper a column of readable serious
stuff about the current movie plays&mdash;real criticism, not
simply the producer&rsquo;s &ldquo;blurb.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Possibly, too, a partnership between the legitimate stage and
the movie may be possible and I shall <span class="pagenum"><a id=
"page323" name="page323"></a>[pg 323]</span>devote to a somewhat
wild scheme of this sort the few pages that remain to me. To begin
with, the freedom enjoyed by the Elizabethan dramatists from the
limitations imposed by realistic scenery has not been sufficiently
insisted upon as an element in their art. Theirs was a true
<em>drame libre</em>, having its analogies with the present
attempts of the vers-librists to free poetry from its restrictions
of rhyme and metre. But while the tendency of poetry has always
been away from its restrictions, the <em>mise-en-sc&eacute;ne</em>
in the drama has continually, with the attempts to make it conform
to nature, tightened its throttling bands on the real vitality of
the stage.</p>
<p>Those who periodically wonder why the dramatists of the
Elizabethan age&mdash;the greatest productive period in the history
of the English stage&mdash;no longer hold the stage, with the
exception of Shakespeare, and who lament that even Shakespeare is
yielding his traditional place, have apparently given little
thought to this loss of freedom as a contributing cause. While the
writers of <em>vers libre</em> have so far freed themselves that
some of them have ceased to write poetry at all, it is a question
whether the scenic freedom of the old dramatists may not have
played such a vital part in the development of their art, that they
owed to it at least some of their pre-eminence.</p>
<p>Shakespeare&rsquo;s plays, as Shakespeare wrote them, read
better than they act. Hundreds of Shakespeare-lovers have reached
this conclusion, and many more have reached it than have dared to
put it into words. The reason is, it seems to me, that we can not,
on the modern stage, enact the plays of Shakespeare as he intended
them to be acted&mdash;as he really wrote them.</p>
<p>If we compare an acting edition of any of the plays with the
text as presented by any good editor, <span class="pagenum"><a id=
"page324" name="page324"></a>[pg 324]</span>this becomes
increasingly clear. Shakespeare in his original garb, is simply
impossible for the modern stage.</p>
<p>The fact that the Elizabethan plays were given against an
imaginary back-ground enabled the playwright to disregard the old,
hampering unity of place more thoroughly than has ever been
possible since his time. His ability to do so, was the result not
of any reasoned determination to set his plays without
&ldquo;scenery,&rdquo; but simply of environment. As the scenic art
progressed, the backgrounds became more and more realistic and less
and less imaginary. The imagination of the audience, however, has
always been more or less requisite to the appreciation of drama, as
of any other art. No stage tree or house has ever been close enough
to its original to deceive the onlooker. He always knows that they
are imitations, intended only to aid the imagination, and his
imagination has always been obliged to do its part. In
Shakespeare&rsquo;s time the imagination did all the work; and as
imaginary houses and trees have no weight, the services of the
scene-shifter were not required to remove them and to substitute
others. The scene could be shifted at once from a battlefield in
Flanders to a palace in London and after the briefest of dialogues
it could change again to a street in Genoa&mdash;all without
inconveniencing anyone or necessitating a halt in the presentation
of the drama. Any reflective reader of Shakespeare will agree, I
think, that this ability to shift scenes, which after all, is only
that which the novelist or poet has always possessed and still
possesses, enables the dramatist to impart a breadth of view that
was impossible under the ideas of unity that governed the drama of
the Ancients. Greek tragedy was drama in concentration, a tabloid
of intense power&mdash;a brilliant light focussed <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page325" name="page325"></a>[pg 325]</span>on a
single spot of passion or exaltation. The Elizabethan drama is a
view of life; and life does not focus, it is diffuse&mdash;a
congeries of episodes, successive or simultaneous&mdash;something
not re-producible by the ancient dramatic methods.</p>
<p>Today, while we have not gone back to the terrific force of the
Greek unified presentation, we have lost this breadth. We strive
for it, but we can no longer reach it because of the growth of an
idea that realism in <em>mise-en-sc&eacute;ne</em> is absolutely
necessary. Of course this idea has been injurious to the drama in
more ways than the one that we are now considering. The notable
reform in stage settings associated with the names of Gordon Craig,
Granville Barker, Urban, Hume and others, arises from a conviction
that <em>mise-en-sc&eacute;ne</em> should inspire and reflect a
mood&mdash;should furnish an atmosphere, rather than attempt to
reproduce realistic details. To a certain extent these reforms also
operate to simplify stage settings and hence to make a little more
possible the quick transitions and the play of viewpoint which I
regard as one of the glories of the Elizabethan drama. This
simplification, however, is very far from a return to the absolute
simplicity of the Elizabethan setting. Moreover, it is doubtful
whether the temper of the modern audience is favorable to a great
change in this direction. We live in an age of realistic detail and
we must yield to the current, while using it, so far as possible,
to gain our ends.</p>
<p>This being the case, it is certainly interesting to find that,
entirely without the aid or consent of those who have at heart the
interests of the drama, a new dramatic form has grown up which
caters to the utmost to the modern desire for realistic
detail&mdash;far beyond the dreams of ordinary stage
settings&mdash;and at the same time makes possible the quick
transitions <span class="pagenum"><a id="page326" name=
"page326"></a>[pg 326]</span>that are the glory of the Elizabethan
drama. Here, of course, is where we make connection with the moving
picture, whose fascinating realism and freedom from the taint of
the footlights have perhaps been sufficiently insisted upon in what
has been already said. In the moving picture, with the possibility
of realistic backgrounds such as no skill, no money, no opportunity
could build up on the ordinary stage&mdash;distant prospects,
marvels of architecture, waving trees and moving
animals&mdash;comes the ability of passing from one environment to
another, on the other side of the globe perhaps, in the twinkling
of an eye. The transitions of the Elizabethan stage sink into
insignificance beside the possibilities of the moving-picture
screen. Such an alternation as is now common in the film play,
where two characters, talking to each other over the telephone, are
seen in quick succession, would be impossible on the ordinary
stage. The Elizabethan auditor, if his imagination were vivid and
ready, might picture such a background of castle or palace or rocky
coast as no photographer could produce; but even such imagination
takes time to get under way, whereas the screen-picture gets to the
brain through the retina instantly.</p>
<p>It is worth our while, I think, to consider whether this kind of
scenery, rich in detail, but immaterial and therefore devoid of
weight, could not be used in connection with the ordinary drama.
There are obstacles, but they do not appear insuperable. The
ordinary moving-picture, of course, is much smaller than the back
drop of a large stage. Its enlargement is merely a matter of
optical apparatus. Wings must be reduced in number and provided
each with its own projection-machine, or replaced with drops
similarly provided. Exits and entrances must be managed somewhat
differently than with ordinary scenery. <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page327" name="page327"></a>[pg 327]</span>All
this is surely not beyond the power of modern stagecraft, which has
already surmounted such obstacles and accomplished such wonders.
The projection, it is unnecessary to say, must be from behind, not
from before, to avoid throwing the actors&rsquo; shadows on the
scenery. There must still, of course, be lighting from the front,
and the shadow problem still exists, but no more than it does with
ordinary scenery. Its solution lies in diffusing the light. No
spotlight could be used, and its enforced absence would be one of
the incidental blessings of the moving scene.</p>
<p>The advantages of this moving-picture scenery would be many and
obvious. Prominent among them of course are fidelity to nature and
richness of detail. The one, however, on which I desire to lay
stress here is the flexibility in change of scene that we have lost
with the introduction of heavy material &ldquo;scenery&rdquo; on
our stages. This flexibility would be regained without the
necessity of discarding scenery altogether and going back to the
Elizabethan reliance on the imagination of the audience.</p>
<p>Of course, moving scenery would not be required or desired in
all dramatic productions&mdash;only in those where realistic detail
combined with perfect flexibility and rapidity of change in scene
seems to be indicated. The scenery should of course be colored, and
while we are waiting for the commercial tri-chroic picture with
absolutely true values, we may get along very well with the
di-chroic ones, such as those turned out with the so-called
Kinemacolor process. Those who saw the wonderful screen
reproduction of the Indian durbar, several years ago, will realize
the possibilities.</p>
<p>And more than all else, may we not hope that these new
backgrounds may react on the players who perform their parts in
front of them? Not necessarily; <span class="pagenum"><a id=
"page328" name="page328"></a>[pg 328]</span>for we have seen that
it does not always do so in the present movie play. But I am
confident that the change will come. Little by little the
necessities of the case are developing actors who act naturally.
One may pose in a canoe on a painted rapid; but how can he do so in
the real water course, where every attitude, every play of the
muscles must be adapted to the real propulsion of the boat?</p>
<p>In short, the movie may ultimately require its presenters to be
real, and so may come a school of realism in acting that may have
its uses on the legitimate stage also.</p>
<p>Who will be the first manager to experiment with this new
adjunct to the art of the stage?</p>

<p class="returnTOC"><a href="#Contents">Return to Table of
Contents</a></p>
<p>People may be divided into a great many different classes
according to their attitude toward belief and beliefs&mdash;toward
the meaning and value of belief in general&mdash;toward their own
beliefs and those of their neighbors. We have the man who does not
know what &ldquo;belief&rdquo; means, and who does not care; the
man whose idea of its meaning is perverse and wrong; the man who
thinks his own beliefs are important and those of his neighbors are
unimportant; the man who thinks it proper to base belief on certain
considerations and not on others&mdash;the man, for instance, who
will say he believes that two plus two equals four, but can not
believe in the existence of God because the grounds for such belief
can not be stated in the same mathematical symbols. These are only
a few of the classes that might be defined, using this interesting
basis of classification. But before we can take up the question of
instruction in the church&rsquo;s beliefs, about which I have been
asked to address you this evening, we must recognize the existence
of these classes, and possibly the fact that you yourselves are not
all in accord in the way in which you look at the subject.</p>
<p>What I shall say is largely personal and you must not look upon
me as representing anybody or anything. I may even fail to agree
with some of the instruction that you have received in this
interesting and valuable course. But I do speak, of course, as one
who loves our church and as a loyal and I hope a thoughtful
layman.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page330" name="page330"></a>[pg
330]</span>First, what is belief? We surely give the word a wide
range of values. A man says that he believes in his own existence,
which the philosopher Descartes said was the most sure thing in the
world&mdash;&ldquo;<em>Cogito, ergo sum</em>&rdquo;. He also says
that he believes it will rain to-morrow. What can there be in
common between these two acts of faith? Between a certainty and a
fifty per cent chance, or less? This&mdash;that a man is always
willing to act on his beliefs; if not, they are not beliefs within
the meaning of this address. If you believe it will rain, you take
an umbrella. Your doing so is quite independent of the grounds for
your belief. There may really be very little chance of its raining;
but it is your belief that causes your action, no matter whether it
is justified or not. You could not act more decisively if you were
acting on the certainty of your own existence. It is this
willingness to act that unifies our beliefs&mdash;that gives them
value. If I heard a man declare his belief that a fierce wild
animal was on his track, and if I then saw him calmly lie down and
go to sleep on the trail, I should know that he was either insane
or a liar.</p>
<p>I have intimated above that belief may or may not be based on
mathematical certainty. Fill up a basket with black and white
pebbles and then draw out one. Let us create a situation that shall
make it imperative for a person to declare whether a black or a
white pebble will be drawn. For instance, suppose the event to be
controlled by an oriental despot who has given orders to strike off
the man&rsquo;s head if he announces the wrong color. Of course, if
he has seen that only white pebbles went into the basket he says
boldly &ldquo;White.&rdquo; That is certainty. But suppose he saw
one black pebble in the mass. Does he any the less say
&ldquo;White&rdquo;? That one black pebble represents a tiny doubt;
does it affect the direction of his enforced <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page331" name="page331"></a>[pg 331]</span>action?
Suppose there were two black pebbles; or a handful. Suppose nearly
half the pebbles were black? Would that make the slightest
difference about what he would do? If you judge a man&rsquo;s
belief by what he does, as I think you should do, that belief may
admit of a good deal of doubt before it is nullified. Are your
beliefs all based on mathematical certainties? I hope not; for then
they must be few indeed.</p>
<p>That many of our fellow men have a wrong conception of belief is
a very sad fact. The idea that it must be based on a mathematical
demonstration of certainty, or even that it must be free from doubt
is surely not Christian. Our prayers and our hymns are full of the
contrary. We are beset not only by &ldquo;fightings&rdquo; but by
&ldquo;fears&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;within; without;&rdquo; by
&ldquo;many a conflict, many a doubt&rdquo;; we pray to be
delivered from this same doubt. The whole body of Christian
doctrine is permeated with the idea that the true believer is
likely to be beset by doubts of all kinds, and that it is his duty,
despite all this, to believe.</p>
<p>And yet there are many who will not call themselves Christians
so long as they can not construct a rigid demonstration of every
Christian doctrine. There are many thoughtful men who call
themselves Agnostics just because they can not be mathematically
sure of religious truth. Some of these men are better Christians
than many that are so named. That they hold aloof from Christian
fellowship is due to their mistaken notion of the nature of belief.
The more is the pity. Now let us go back for a moment to our basket
of pebbles. We have seen that the action of the guesser is based to
some extent on his knowledge of the contents of the basket. In
other words, he has grounds for the belief by which his act
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page332" name="page332"></a>[pg
332]</span>is conditioned. Persons may act without grounds; it may
be necessary for them so to do. Even in this case there may be a
sort of blind substitute for belief. A man, pursued by a bear,
comes to a fork in the road. He knows nothing about either branch;
one may lead to safety and one to a jungle. But he has to choose,
and choose at once; and his choice represents his bid for safety.
There is plenty of action of this sort in the world; if we would
avoid the necessity for it we must do a little preliminary
investigation; and if we can not find definitely where the roads
lead, we may at least hit upon some idea of which is the
safest.</p>
<p>But with all our investigation we shall find that we must rely
in the end on our trust in some person; either ourselves or someone
else. Even the certainty of the mathematical formula depends on our
confidence in the sanity of our own mental processes. The man who
sees the basket filled with white pebbles must trust the accuracy
of his eyesight. If he relies for his information on what someone
else told him, he must trust not only that other&rsquo;s eyesight,
but his memory, his veracity, his friendliness. And yet one may be
far safer in trusting another than in relying on his own unaided
powers. <em>Securus judicat orbis terrarum</em>, says the old
Latin. &ldquo;The world&rsquo;s judgment is safe.&rdquo; We have
learned to modify this, for we have seen world judgments that are
manifestly incorrect. The world thought the earth was flat. It
thought there were witches, and it burned them. Here individuals
simply followed one another like sheep; and all, like sheep, went
astray. But where there is a real, independent judgment on the part
of each member of a group, and all agree, that is better proof of
its correctness than most individual investigations could furnish.
My watch, of the best make and carefully regulated, indicates five
o&rsquo;clock, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page333" name=
"page333"></a>[pg 333]</span>but if I meet five friends, each of
whom tells me, independently, that it is six, I conclude that my
watch is wrong. There was never a more careful scientific
investigation than that by which a French physicist thought he had
established the existence of what he called the &ldquo;N
ray&rdquo;&mdash;examined its properties and measured its
constants. He read paper after paper before learned bodies as his
research progressed. He challenged the interest of his brother
scientists on three continents. And yet he was entirely wrong:
there never was any &ldquo;N ray.&rdquo; The man had deceived
himself. The failure of hundreds to see as he did weighed more than
his positive testimony that he saw what he thought he saw. Here as
elsewhere our view of what may be the truth is based on trust. If
you trust the French physicist, you will still believe in the
&ldquo;N ray.&rdquo; Creeds we are told, are outworn, and yet we
are confronted, from birth to death, with situations that
imperiously require action of some sort. Every act that responds
must be based on belief of some kind. Creeds are only expressions
of belief. The kind of Creed that <em>is</em> outworn (and this is
doubtless what intelligent persons mean when they make this
statement) is the parrot creed, the form of words without meaning,
the statement of belief without any grounds behind it or any action
in front of it. For this the modern churchman has no use.</p>
<p>And if he desires to avoid the parrot creed, he must surely
inform himself regarding the meaning of its articles and the
grounds on which they are held. More; he must satisfy himself of
the particular meaning that they have for him and the personal
grounds on which he is to hold them. This is the reason why such a
course as that which you complete to-night is necessary and
valuable. I have heard instruction of this kind deprecated as
likely to bring disturbing elements <span class="pagenum"><a id=
"page334" name="page334"></a>[pg 334]</span>into the mind. One may
doubtless change from belief to skepticism by too much searching.
It used to be a standing joke in Yale College, when I was a student
there, that a well-known professor reputed to be an Atheist, had
been perfectly orthodox until he had heard President Porter&rsquo;s
lectures on the &ldquo;Evidences of Christianity.&rdquo; But
seriously, this objection is but another phase of the fallacy at
which we have already glanced&mdash;that doubts are fatal to
belief. I am certain that the professor in question might have
examined in detail every one of President Porter&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Evidences,&rdquo; and found them wanting, only to discover
clearer and stronger grounds of belief elsewhere&mdash;in his mere
confidence in others, perhaps. Or he might have turned pragmatist
and believed in Christianity because it
&ldquo;worked&rdquo;&mdash;a valid reason in this case doubtless,
but not always to be depended on; because the Father of Lies
sometimes makes things &ldquo;work&rdquo; himself&mdash;at least
temporarily.</p>
<p>But if examining into the grounds of his belief makes a man
honestly give up that belief, then I bid him God-speed. I may weep
for him, but I cannot help believing that he stands better with his
Maker for being honest with himself than if he had gone on with his
parrot belief that meant absolutely nothing. I can not feel that
the Aztecs who were baptized by the followers of Cortes were any
more believers in Christianity after the ceremony than they were
before. It seems to me, however that a Christian, examining
faithfully the grounds of his belief, will usually have that belief
strengthened, and that a churchman, examining the doctrines of the
church will be similarly upheld.</p>
<p>Not that church instruction should be one-sided. The teaching
that tends to make us believe that every intelligent man thinks as
we do reacts against itself. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page335"
name="page335"></a>[pg 335]</span>It is like the unfortunate
temperance teaching that represents the liking for wine as always
acquired. When the pupil comes to taste wine and finds that he
likes it at once, he concludes that the whole body of instruction
in the physiology of alcohol is false and acts accordingly. When a
boy is taught that there is nothing of value beyond his own church,
or nothing of value outside of Christianity, he will think less of
his church, and less of Christianity when he finds intelligent,
upright, lovable outsiders. I look back with horror on some of the
books, piously prepared under the auspices of the S.P.C.K. in
London, that I used to take home from Sunday School. In them we
were told that a good man outside the church was worse than a bad
man in it. If that was not the teaching in the book, it was at
least the form in which it took lodgment in my boyish brain. Thank
God it never found permanent foothold there. Instead, I hold in my
memory the Eastern story of God&rsquo;s rebuke to Abraham when he
expelled the Fire Worshipper from his tent. &ldquo;Could you not
bear with him for one hour? Lo! I have borne with him these forty
years!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I have always thought that a knowledge of what our neighbors
believe is an excellent balance-wheel to our own beliefs and that
our own beliefs, so balanced, will be saner and more restrained. It
would be well, I think, if we could have a survey of the
world&rsquo;s religions, setting down in parallel columns all the
faiths of mankind. If this is too great a task we might begin with
a survey of Christianity, set down in the same way. I believe that
the results of such a survey might surprise us, showing, as I think
it would do, the many fundamentals that we hold in common and the
trivial nature of some of the barriers that appear to separate
us.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page336" name="page336"></a>[pg
336]</span>In your course, just completed, you have had such a
survey, I doubt not, of the beliefs of our own beloved church.
Where her divines have differed, you have had the varying opinions
spread before you. You have not been told that the mind of every
churchman has always been a replica of the mind of every other
churchman. Personally, I feel grateful that this has not been the
case. As I say my creed and begin &ldquo;I believe in God, the
Father Almighty,&rdquo; I realize that the aspect of even such a
basic belief as this, is the same in no two minds; that it shifts
from land to land and from age to age. I know that God, as he is,
is past human knowledge and that until we see Him face to face we
can not all mean just the same thing when we repeat this article of
belief. But I realize also that this is not due to the mutability
of the Almighty but to man&rsquo;s variability. The Gods of St.
Jerome, of Thomas Carlyle and of William James are different; but
that is because these men had different types of minds. Behind
their human ideas stands God himself&mdash;&ldquo;the same
yesterday, to-day and forever.&rdquo; So we may go through the
creed; so we may study, as you have been doing, the beliefs of the
church. Everywhere we see the evidences of the working, upon
fallible human minds of a dim appreciation of something beyond full
human knowledge&mdash;</p>

<p>We have a wonderful church, my friends. It is a church to live
with; a church to be proud of. Those who miss what we are
privileged to enjoy are missing something from the fulness of life.
We have not broken with the historic continuity of the Christian
faith: there is no chasm, filled with wreckage, between us and the
fathers of the church. Above all we have enshrined our beliefs in a
marvellous liturgy, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page337" name=
"page337"></a>[pg 337]</span>which is ever old and ever new, and
which had the good fortune to be put into English at a day when the
force of expression in our Mother tongue was peculiarly virile, yet
peculiarly lovely. I know of nothing in the whole range of English
literature that will compare with the collects as contained in our
Book of Common Prayer, for beauty, for form, for condensation and
for force. They are a string of pearls. And indeed, what I have
said of them applies to the whole book. When I see Committees of
well-meaning divines trying to tamper with it, I shudder as I might
if I witnessed the attempt of a guild of modern sculptors to
improve the Venus of Milo by chipping off a bit here and adding
something there. Good reasons exist for changes, doubtless; but I
feel that we have here a work of art, of divine art; and art is one
of God&rsquo;s ways of reaching the human heart. We are proud that
we have not discarded it from our church buildings, from our
altars, from the music of our choirs. Let us treat tenderly our
great book of Common Prayer, like that other great masterpiece of
divine literary art, the King James version of the Bible. There are
plenty of better translations; there is not one that has the same
magic of words to fire the imagination and melt the heart.</p>
<p>These are all trite things to say to churchmen: I have tried, on
occasion, to say them to non-churchmen, but they do not seem to
respond. There are those who rejoice in their break with historic
continuity, who look upon a written form of service with horror. It
is well, as I have said, for us to realize that our friends hold
these opinions. One can not strengthen his muscles in a tug of war
unless some one is pulling the other way. The savor of religion,
like that of life itself, is in its contrasts. I thank God that we
have them even within our own Communion. <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page338" name="page338"></a>[pg 338]</span>We are
high-church and low-church and broad-church. We burn incense and we
wear Geneva gowns. This diversity is not to be condemned. What is
to be deprecated is the feeling among some of us that the diversity
should give place to uniformity&mdash;to uniformity of their own
kind, of course. To me, this would be a calamity. Let us continue
to make room in our church for individuality. God never intended
men to be pressed down in one mold of sameness. In the last
analysis, each of us has his own religious beliefs. The doctrines
of our church, or of any church are but a composite portrait of
these beliefs. But when one takes such a portrait throughout all
lands and in all time, and the features keep true, one can not help
regarding them as the divine lineaments.</p>
<p>This is how I would have you regard the beliefs of our church,
as you have studied them throughout this course&mdash;as our
particular composite photograph of the face of God, as He has
impressed it on the hearts and minds of each one of us. I commend
this view to those who have no reverence for beliefs, particularly
when they are formulated as creeds. These persons mean that they
have no regard for group beliefs but only for those of the
individual. Each has his own beliefs, and he must have confidence
in them, for they are the grounds on which he acts, if he is a
normal man. Even the faith of an Agnostic is based on a very
positive belief. As for me, I feel that the churchman goes one step
beyond him: he even doubts Doubt. Said Socrates: &ldquo;I know
nothing except this one thing, that I know nothing. The rest of you
are ignorant even of this.&rdquo; Socrates was a great man. If he
had been greater still, he might have said something like this:
&ldquo;I freely acknowledge that a mathematical formula can not
satisfy all the cases that we discuss. But neither can it be stated
mathematically <span class="pagenum"><a id="page339" name=
"page339"></a>[pg 339]</span>that they are all unknowable. I am not
even sure that I know nothing.&rdquo; Surely, under these
circumstances, we may give over looking for mathematical
demonstrations and believe a few things on our own
account&mdash;that our children love us&mdash;that our eyes do not
deceive us; that the soul lives on; that God rules all. We may put
our faith in what our own church teaches us, even as a child trusts
his father though he can not construct a single syllogism that will
increase that trust.</p>
<p>This does not mean that we shall not benefit by examining the
articles of our faith; by learning what they are, what they mean
and what others have thought of them. The churchman must combine,
in his mental habits, all that is best of the Conservative and the
Radical. While holding fast that which is good he must keep an open
mind toward every change that may serve to bring him nearer to the
truth or give him a clearer vision of it.</p>
<p>How we can insure this better than by such an institution as the
Church School for Religious Instruction I am sure I do not see. May
God guide it and aid it in its work!</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
